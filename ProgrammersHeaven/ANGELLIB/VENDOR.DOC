    컴컴컴컴 ANGELIB 1.9a  5/16/1993

    This is an Unregistered Edition of my BC7 applications development
    library.  ANGELIB contains around 60 high-level routines such as a
    scrollable information window, a simple "Ok" button, back-up/restore
    functions, a file selection window, and printer font management.
    Mouse support is included where applicable.

    The Unregistered Edition now has a full LIB file (for use in making
    EXE files) and instructions on creating a QLB file. Registered users
    get the object (OBJ) modules which can be used to make custom
    libraries. Source code license also available.

    Documentation on-disk is provided in TWO FORMATS:  ASCII and
    WordPerfect 5.1.  If the user has WordPerfect (or a conversion
    utility) the documentation can be properly formatted for their
    printer, taking advantage of special fonts and in many cases saving
    paper.
