    It's still in the development stage, and has several quirks which
    need to be worked around. But, once you're familiar with it, that's
    not too much trouble.

    Sure.

    Firstly, to explain a little further about MoonRock, here is the
    FILE_ID.DIZ from the release archive:


    ----begin FILE_ID.DIZ-------------------------------------------------
    MoonRock is a BASIC-like language
    with several extensions. Produces
    small and tight executables.

    Includes compiler, ArrowSoft
    assembler, documentation and
    sample programs.

    I originally began work on MoonRock because I was dissatisfied with
    the bloated executables that QuickBASIC and other MicroSoft BASICs
    produce. Before I moved to the PC world in 1992, I had been coding
    in 6502 ASM on a machine with typically less than 32k RAM, so I
    could certainly appreciate the need for tight code. My only other
    language was BASIC. This particular machine (BBC Model B 6502 2MHz
    32K RAM) had an assembler embedded into the BASIC interpreter, which
    allowed me to freely mix both languages.

    As I gradually moved over to 80x86 assembly I became interested in
    how compilers converted high level source into low level ASM or
    machine code. I thought I would give it a try myself. When I
    originally started MoonRock, I had little experience: I had never
    written or designed a compiler, and did not know many fundamental
    techniques. I had plenty of ideas. I made several mistakes along the
    way, some that affect the direction the compiler has taken, but I've
    certainly learnt a lot, too.

    MoonRock has now been in development for over 15 months (the oldest
    archive I have is dated 1st-Nov-1994). Over that time it has grown
    significantly, both in power and internal complexity.

    Currently there is only a single person (myself) involved in the
    development of MoonRock, and it is done in my spare time.

    Now for some more detail about MoonRock: the compiler translates a
    BASIC-like source file into assembler source (ASM). This is then
    assembled with an assembler such as MASM, TASM, A86, or ArrowSoft,
    then finally linked to produce an executable (either COM or EXE).
    Each ASM produced by MoonRock is entirely standalone and does not
    need to be linked with external libraries: one of the oddities of
    the compiler is that the library functions are *included* in the
    output ASM file. This is not as silly as it sounds, because it means
    that the code for the library functions can change dynamically from
    compile to compile, depending on which switches or directives are
    used. For example, if 386+ code generation is specified, then
    several of the string handling libraries use MOVSD (move doubleword,
    386+) instead of MOVSW.

    MoonRock's code generation is of average to good quality. It uses
    register based parameter passing to most internal functions and
    procedures. Simple functions (such as ABS) are performed "inline" so
    as not to add the overhead of calling a function. The compiler
    provides simple optimisations such as not saving a register to a
    memory address and then reloading it straight back (MicroSoft BASICs
    are guilty of not doing this blatantly obvious optimisation).

    The library functions themselves are, in their "release" form, as
    tight as possible. When the debug switch is specified with the
    compiler, extra hand-holding code is included into the functions to
    catch potential errors. Thus, for debugging one can include the
    necessary hand-holding, but a release compile will be free of the
    extra size and loss of speed. The included ASM library contains
    5,000+ lines of ASM.

    Startup code is small. A program to print "Hello World" is 220 bytes
    (compiled with MRC v0.15.b4 with switch "/-C"). The startup and
    cleanup code also changes dynamically depending on commandline
    switches.

    Generally MoonRock executables will be compiled for smallest size.

    Briefly, these are the features and limits of MoonRock:

      + Small executable output generation ("Hello World" = 220 bytes)
      + Syntax similar to BASIC
      + Numerical arrays may be explicitly placed in FAR (64k seg limit)
          or HUGE (>64k) memory, to free up data segment space
      + Memory can be allocated by the programmer
      + Limited support for pointers (under development)
      + Can produce code to link with QuickBASIC code
      + Supports BYTE size variable type
      + Has screen drivers for DOS, BIOS, and direct screen writes
      + Control characters can be embedded into string literals, eg:
                print "Hello world\n\n"
                    instead of:
                print "Hello world" + chr$(13) + chr$(10) + chr$(13)
                   + chr$(10)

      - Floating point not yet supported
      - Bracketing in evaluation not yet supported, eg:
                a% = ((c% - 2) * d%) + 5
        The evaluation must be done separately thus:
                temp1% = c% - 2
                temp2% = temp1% * d%
                a% = temp2% + 5
      - FUNCTIONs not yet supported
      - Variables are limited to a single 64k segment, except for FAR
          and HUGE byte, word and doubleword arrays
      - Limit of 64k code+stack (similar to "SMALL" memory model)
      - Graphics not yet supported


    So much for the current version. A newer version is being developed,
    this time in "native" MoonRock. It is far more powerful, for example
    you can throw it this expression:

    a% = c% * (5 + 3) - ((2 - d% + (e% * 3) * 5) + (c% * 2) + (e% - 2) - 3)

    ... and it evaluates the brackets in the correct order.

    It supports FUNCTIONs.

    It has generally better code creation, and a post-optimiser which
    makes use of available registers, to speed evaluation in the
    compiled executable.

    It is more reliable at catching compile-time (source code) errors.

    It is much a much faster compiler, and is smaller (due to it being
    compiled by MoonRock).


    Basically (no pun intended), the newer version blows the old one out
    of the water, and makes it look rather primitive. There are some
    minor changes to the language elements, but I'll be including a
    convertor. Some of the changes are already present in the current
    version of MoonRock (for example, in the current version you can use
    either END SUB or RETURN to mark the end of a subroutine block; in
    the newer version RETURN will be used for something else).

    The newer version is still under development, and will not be
    released for several months, although Beta versions will be released
    before then.

    Finally, here is a simple MoonRock program which shows a listing of
    the specified files. I have modified it slightly to make it more
    readable.
