     Thank you for downloading me!!!

     This program is modeled after the program "Gravitational
Grid" by Patrick D. Grengs II. His program appeared in the
October 1988 issue of the Rainbow Magazine. This is the
uncompiled, QuickBASIC 4.5 version. If you don't have QB, then I
suggest you get the compiled version.

     Warp Field Animator uses trigonometry to plot animated
or high resolution displays of warped fields or checker
boards. The program should(no guarantees, though) be able to
handle EGA only computers, but I can't find a computer with
EGA only so I couldn't test out that aspect of the program.
Also, the program assumes that if you have VGA capability,
then you also have EGA capability.
     To run the program, you must start QuickBASIC up with the
/ah option:
c:\qb45\QB /AH  <---(the /ah option may not be needed???)


     Then, load the program in from the file menu and press
Shift+F5 to execute it.

     If you get an error message from QB, then you don't
have EGA or VGA capability(which means the program won't
work), or you don't have enough free RAM memory for the
program or data structures. The uncompiled version run in the
QuickBASIC environment takes up a lot of memory- try compiling it
if QB gives the dreaded "Out of Memory" error, and running it
from DOS.

     Basically, here is what you have to do to see an
animated grid:
     1. Adjust the parameters, if you want to. The parameters
are set to a default state when the program begins.
     2. Select the influences with the keyboard. If you don't
select any influences, the grid will appear normal(and very
bland). The four types of influences are: right tornado, left
tornado, upward "blip", and downward "blip" (or hole).
     3. Plot the screen(s). This will calculate, draw, and
animate the field. Note, that if the high resolution mode(VGA
only) is selected via the parameters menu, the field will
only be a single frame.

               The main menu has three options:

Adjust Parameters:  Allows the modifying of the default
                    parameters.
Select Influences:  Allows the user to select points of
                    influences on the grid.
Calculate and Plot Screen(s):  Usually the last option
                    selected: Calculates, plots, and shows
                    the finished screen(s).

          Information on the Adjust Parameters menu:

X Step: The number of pixels(dots) between each block
horizontally. The larger this number, the lower the detail.
Normally 10 pixels.

Y Step: The number of pixels between each block vertically.
Again, the larger this number, the lower the detail. Normally
10 pixels.

Maximum Angle of Rotation: This option affects only
tornados(and not the trailer park type!). The larger the
number, the more the tornado will turn. Normally 90 degrees.

Type of Screen: Animated(EGA or VGA) or High Resolution(VGA
only).

Type of Filling: This option affects the filling process of
the grid. Note that the special filling algorithm is VERY
slow compared to the normal filling algorithm. Use it only on
very complex grids that don't fill good with the Normal
option. The shades option(VGA only) creates very nice looking
color bars which "warp" with the picture. Looks pretty good.

Type of gravity: This option selects which algorithm the
program will use to generate the upward and downward
influences. Linear is like a sphere, and normal is like a
smooth bump. I like Linear myself, because it affects the
grid more, and it calculates quicker.

             Information on Selecting Influences

     When this option is selected, full instructions on what
keys to use will be shown. You may select up to 10 influences
on the grid: but beware, the more influences you select the
longer it will take to calculate! When you select the 10th
influence, you will be returned to the main menu.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   WHILE WATCHING AN ANIMATED FIELD, USE THE LEFT AND RIGHT
  ARROW KEYS TO CHANGE THE TIME BETWEEN EACH FRAME!!! IF THE
 PAGE FLIPPING IS TOO QUICK(WHICH IT PROBABLY WILL BE), THEN
            USE THE ARROW KEYS TO SLOW IT DOWN!!!


                       Note to Scumbags...
     Please don't be a scumbag and change the program without
"due process." (who knows what due process is!!) Wouldn't you be
mad if somebody stole your hard work and took all the credit for
it?

     If you have any questions, complaints, or comments, then
I write/call me at...

I'll be more than glad to listen to anything you have to say(good
or bad!).


          Notes on Saving the High Resolution Screen
     If you would like to save the high resolution screen,
then I recommend a TSR utility which saves whatever the
screen is showing(usually in the GIF format) when certain
key(s) are pressed. I did have a saving feature, but it was
just too slow in QuickBASIC to be practical. A TSR utility is
the easiest solution.

     I hope you enjoy this program as much as I enjoyed
making it!
