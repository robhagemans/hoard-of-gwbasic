     If you get stuck while using PB/VISION(tm), this is the file to
     consult.  If you don't find what your are looking for, please
     consult the documentation section covering "Technical Support".
     We're fun people to talk to so stay calm and give us a call.


     PROBLEM:  All of a sudden your program starts having "Exception
               #12" errors.

     SOLUTION: This is caused by having too small of a stack and
               occurs if you have deeply nested subroutines or
               subroutines with a lot of local variables.  It can be
               fixed by creating a larger stack with the $STACK
               command (ie $STACK 8192).

               Stack errors are the most common and hard to find bugs
               on the planet.  Anytime you have a bug that you just
               cannot explain, try increasing the size of the stack
               with $STACK.  Not too big though.


     PROBLEM:  When attempting to run any of the example programs or
               tutorial programs,  PowerBASIC displays the message
               "Error 519: Missing Declaration".

     SOLUTION: From within PowerBASIC (PB.EXE), select the following
               from the pulldown menu "Options|Compiler|Variable
               Declarations". Select the "None" options to turn off
               variable checking.


     PROBLEM:  When resuming execution after hitting a breakpoint, the
               mouse is dead.

     SOLUTION: Apparently, PowerBASIC resets the mouse when it hits a
               breakpoint, but doesn't restore it afterward.  Your
               only option is to turn off PB.EXE's use of the mouse
               under the "Options|Environment" menu.


     PROBLEM:  The mouse cursor in PowerBASIC is garbled after ending
               the program or hitting a breakpoint.

     SOLUTION: This is a side effect of trying to to mix graphics in
               text mode.  To avoid the problem, you should use the
               text block cursor in the IDE, and switch to the
               graphical mouse only in a compiled program.  See
               APP.GRAPHICSMOUSE for more info.


     PROBLEM:  If the program doesn't end normally, a lot of my screen
               characters look funny?

     SOLUTION: This is a side effect of "Graphics Mapping".  If your
               program never reaches the APPCLOSE() routine, the video
               card doesn't get reset.  There is _NO_ harm in this.
               Everything on your screen should still be 100% readable
               and after a day or so, you won't even notice it.  If it
               really bothers you, set APP.GRAPHICSMODE to 0.


     PROBLEM.  When I run one of my programs from the DOS command
               line, a "registration notice" pops up at the end of the
               program.

     SOLUTION: PB/VISION(tm) LITE is distributed as shareware.  The
               screen is only there to remind you of the fact, and it
               only comes up when the program is compiled to an EXE.
               It doesn't come up in the IDE because it would really
               become a nuisance and cause you to think unkindly of
               us.  The registered version does _not_ do this.


     QUESTION. Is it true that you met Elvis while your were being
               held captive by aliens from the planet Phernabulax?

     ANSWER:   No.  That was blown completely out of proportion.  He
               was just an Elvis impersonator.


     PROBLEM:. After assigning a function with WININSTALLCODE() or
               TIMERINSTALLCODE(), the computer freezes.

     SOLUTION: Check to make sure that you formatted the function
               correctly.  You can import templates for both from the
               help system.  Press <CTRL-F1> until our help system
               comes up.


     PROBLEM:  Two cars are on a collision course on the Interstate.
               Cars "A" and "B" are maintaining a constant of speed of
               65 mph and 45 mph, respectively.

               When the two cars are exactly 55 miles apart, a lonely
               bored fly (on a caffeine binge) starts flying from car
               "A" to car "B" at a steady speed of 92 mph.  When the
               fly reaches car "B" it zips around and heads back
               towards car "A".  It keeps going from car to car until
               both cars collide.

               How many miles did the fly travel before getting
               squashed between the two colliding cars?

     SOLUTION: Bwah-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I'll never tell.
