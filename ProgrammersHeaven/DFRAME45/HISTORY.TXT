Version 4.5
-----------
(06-28-93)
  Well, looks like DoorFrame has finally grown to big for it's britches!
 Wondered how long it would take with all the new stuff I've been adding.
 Have had reports of String Space Corrupt errors which means it's time to
 trim it down a bit. Consequently I had to decide what to discard. It was
 a hard decision but I decided to drop support for WWIV's CHAIN.TXT file.
 This will probably upset a few people but I tried to pick something that
 would affect the least amount of systems.
 Again, DOORFRAME NO LONGER SUPPORTS WWIV AND CHAIN.TXT.

(06-25-93)
  Changed the way ENTER operates. Previously, it would accept any keystroke
 and go on it's merry way. It now must actually receive an Enter key. This
 change was made mainly for PCBoard/M. Although DoorFrame works flawlessly
 with the vast majority of the systems running the M version, I have had a
 couple of reports that on a few systems they are still getting 4 or 5
 random characters at the start of the door. By using the ENTER subroutine
 at the bottom of your opening screen, it should catch any extraneous
 characters that should happen to pop up at the beginning (up to 80).

  Added another variable (like we NEED another one!). Check4RIP% lets you
 the programmer decide if you want to check for RIPscrip compatibility.
 Obviously if your door doesn't send RIPscrip codes, you could care less
 if the remote is RIP compatible or not. The default for Check4RIP% is 0
 which does not check. If you do want to check for RIPscrip, populate the
 variable with a non-zero value. You must assign this variable before calling
 Detect.Ansi.

Version 4.4
-----------
(06-17-93)  
  DoorFrame will now recognize RIPscrip! There are two new variables
 available, Rip% and Rip$. Rip% will be 0 if RIPscrip was not detected and
 1 if it was. Rip$ will contain the RIPscrip version number in the format
 RIPSCRIPxxyyzz where xx = major version number, yy = minor version number
 and zz = revision code. For example if the version number is v1.52.00 
 Rip$ would contain RIPSCRIP015200.
  The Graphics% variable is not adjusted in response to the presence or 
 absence of RIPscrip.

Version 4.3
-----------
(06-13-93)
  Finally got this sucker to work with the PCBoard/M version! Although I
 have no way of testing, it should also work with the Wildcat! IM software.
 Maybe some of you Wildcatters can shoot me some feedback on whether it
 does or not.
  There is a trade-off involved (naturally!).  I still can't figure out
 where the *'s are coming from so the only solution I could come up with was
 to ignore any *'s. So if you have any In.Put statements that require an *
 as a response, you will have to change it. This only applies when the /FD
 (fossil driver) parameter is being used. When no fossil is being used, the
 * is accepted like always.

Version 4.2
-----------
(04-21-93)
  Added the RIP color switch for Wildcat! systems. Color is now displayed if
 either GR or RIP is detected in the Wildcat! DOOR.SYS file.

(04-20-93)
  When adding the addtional colors for the shadow in the Box.It routine, I
 neglected to allow for Black as a color! Therefore, 0 now indicates a Black
 shadow and -1 indicates no shadow is to be used.

(04-18-93)
  Added the Cipher routines from the PBClone library. These two routines
  (Cipher and CipherP) allow simple text encryption/decryption with password
  protection. Check the PBC-SUBS.DOC file for instructions on their use.

(04-16-93)
  Added the ClearBuffer routine. This routine allows you to clear either
 the keyboard buffer, the communications input buffer, or both. Parameters 
 are: 0 = Clear both, 1 = Clear comm. input only, 2 = Clear keyboard only.

(04-13-93)
  Added another parameter to the SendAnsi routine. The third parameter is
 Inter% and indicates whether or not to disable the ability to interrupt
 the ANSI file with the spacebar as it is displaying. 0 = Don't disable, 
 1 = Disable. The default is 0.

(03-29-93)
  Added support for PCBoard v15.0 Alias name. I added this because the
 ALIAS$ variable was already in DoorFrame. I will not be adding the rest of
 the new stuff from v15.0 as that would needlessly inflate the size of the
 library to support only one system. (so don't ask!)

Version 4.1
-----------
(03-25-93)
  Well my tweaking of the DETECT.ANSI routine didn't work quite the way it
 was intended to! Consequently it is back to the way it was before.

(03-24-93)
  When using the Box.It routine, you may now specify a background color to
 be used for the Shadow% parameter. 0 = No Shadow, 1 - 7 = Background Color
 for the Shadow.

(03-20-93)
  Fixed a problem with clearing the screen on the local display when in 
 ASCII only mode.

(03-14-93)
  Tweaked the DETECT.ANSI routine a bit. Hopefully it will do away with
 those non-ANSI messages when ANSI is actually there!

Version 4.0
-----------
(02-25-93)
  Well of course I had to screw something up when expanding the COM port
 range! This only affected the DORINFOx.DEF systems but any COM port above
 one got changed back to 1 which would usually result in a carrier lost
 message.

(02-09-93)
  Finally got around to expanding the COM port range. DoorFrame now supports
 COM 0 thru 15.

Version 3.9
-----------
(01-12-93)
  Silly me! When checking for the fossil driver parameter I neglected to put
 the / in there. So it was checking for FD instead of /FD. That means if your
 .CFG filename contained those 2 letters (as in dFDdemo!), it would pick that
 up as the fossil parameter. Corrected now.

(01-07-93)
  That old problem with the time expired when the Display was toggled off
 in PCBoard popped up again! Fixed one more time (gotta quit changing things).

(01-03-93)
  Removed the CLRSCRN during the INTIALIZE process so now clearing the
 screen is up to you at the beginning of the door.

(12-23-92)
  Fixed a stupid error on my part in the SENDANSI routine. I was opening the
 file as FIL but was closing FILE! So the open file handles would just stack
 up everytime the routine was called.

(12-12-92)
  Added a new routine called SendAnsi. This routine is for true ANSI files
 only! It sends the entire file non-stop. Pressing the Spacebar aborts the
 file send. See the .DOC file for an explanation of accepted parameters.

Version 3.8
-----------
(11-24-92)
  Noticed that I had only allowed for a single digit when specifying a
 non-standard IRQ. That has been changed to accept 2 digits.

(11-19-92)
  DoorFrame will now recognize the %pcbnode% and %wcnodeid% environment
 variables when reading the path to the system file (1st line of the .CFG).
 Some examples:
    PCBoard: If USERS.SYS is located in C:\PCB\NODE1 directory, 
       %pcbdrive%%pcbdir%\NODE%pcbnode%\USERS.SYS
    Wildcat!: USERINFO.DAT located in C:\WC\NODE3 directory,
       C:\WC\NODE%wcnodeid%\USERINFO.DAT
    or if you SET the %pcbdrive% and %pcbdir% variables via the batch,
       %pcbdrive%%pcbdir%\NODE%wcnodeid%\USERINFO.DAT

(11-15-92)
  Changed the code so that USERINFO.DAT is written automatically. Therefore
 you no longer need to use the User.Info% variable. Also took the routine
 out that writes DOOR.SYS when using USERINFO.DAT. Since WildCat! doesn't
 read it back in, that was sorta useless. (Thanks Dennis!)

(11-01-92)
  DoorFrame now includes support for FOSSIL drivers!!! This means your Doors
 will work with most multi-port boards. To activate the Fossil driver 
 support, just include /FD on the command line when running the Door. 
 For example: MYDOOR MYDOOR.CFG /FD
 If no Fossil driver is available, DoorFrame will display a message to that
 effect and exit gracefully.

(10-24-92)
  Some of you may have noticed a slow down in the Dis.Play command after the
 color codes were added (~, `, @, ^, |, {, and }). Dis.Play now has an 
 additional parameter (Codes%) that let's you specify whether or not you 
 are using the color codes. If a particular Dis.Play statement doesn't use
 the codes, place a 0 in the Codes% parameter and the routine that checks
 for and strips those characters will be bypassed. Thus significantly
 increasing the display speed.

(10-23-92)
  Added 2 more parameters to the In.Put command. These new parameters allow
 you to specify a different color if you populate the Text$ parameter. Refer
 to the docs for a full explanation.

Version 3.7
-----------
(10-19-92)
  Well, should have known I would screw something up! Sure enough I did on
 the LastOn$ variable. In the USERS file, it is in the format YYMMDD and 
 is converted to the MM-DD-YY format when read. I neglected to convert it
 back when writing to the USERS file.

(10-18-92)
  Would you believe ... all this time DoorFrame has been reading info from
 the PCBoard USERS file but hasn't been writing it! Actually, this would 
 only affect a few of the variables. Anyway, that oversight has been
 corrected. (Thanks Peter!)

(10-10-92)
  Had reports of conflicts when using non-standard IRQ's on Novell/Netware
 systems. Seems Novell also uses the / character so something went screwy
 somewhere. So I added the * (asterisk) which may be used instead of the /
 in case of a conflict. In other words, /%IRQ% and *%IRQ% will both work
 and are interchangeable.

(09-23-92)
  Fixed a bug when restoring the screen after Chat or Drop to DOS. It would
 generate an illegal function call whenever it hit a blinking character.

(09-22-92)
  You now have the option of taking control after a carrier loss in case you
 need to do some clean-up before recycling back to the BBS. BE VERY CAREFUL
 with this one! Check the Docs under Miscellaneous Notes for an explanation.

Version 3.6
-----------
(09-20-92)
   Fixed a problem when using the new no-show option of In.Put. If you used
  a Dis.Play statement with color codes immediately after that, it would
  show the color codes rather than the color.

(09-14-92)
  The In.Put command now features word-wrap ability! If you put, for example,
 160 as the first parameter, it will wrap around at the nearest space when it
 reaches column 80 on the screen. Backspacing also works over the word-wrap.

  DoorFrame will now handle the 30-something line DOOR.SYS file as well as 
 the 52-line one.

  Corrected some errors in writing the SFDOORS.DAT file. Specifically the
 COMPORT% and DAILY.BYTES.ALWD& variables.

  Added 5 new parameters to the In.Put command. 
      AutoCR% - Automatic Carriage Return. 0 = No, 1 = Yes
      Text$   - Text to display (if any).
      Xpos%   - X coordinate to print Text$
      Ypos%   - Y coordinate to print Text$
      Show%   - 0 = Don't display response, 1 = display response
 For example:

    In.Put 5, 0, 11, 0, 0, "", 0, 0, 1

 would accept 5 characters but would not return until the user hits the
 ENTER key. Conversely,

    In.Put 5, 0, 11, 0, 1, "Well? ", 20, 1, 1

 would accept 5 characters and automatically return from the routine. It will
 also print 'Well? ' at location 20, 1 and the response would be displayed.
 If you wanted a Hot Key and didn't want the response to show:

    In.Put 1, 0, 11, 0, 1, "Y/N ", 20, 1, 0

 would prompt for 'Y/N' but would not display the response. The variable
 Response$ will still contain whatever was typed even though it didn't show
 up on the screen.

(09-11-92)  
  Finally installed the screen restore when coming back from Chat or a Drop
 to Dos. Been wanting to do that for months now! It will now put the screen
 back like it was including anything typed at an In.Put prompt. If the caller
 had entered anything before the interruption, that is restored and he can
 pick up right where he left off!

Version 3.5
-----------
(09-06-92)
  Had a request to be able to turn off the Status lines at the bottom of the
 screen so that has been installed. To blank out those 2 lines, set the
 variable No.Status% = 1 and do a ClrScrn. Sorry but those 2 lines are still
 not available for printing (that would mean changing half the routines in
 DoorFrame!).

(09-05-92)
  Fixed an intermittent problem with the cursor jumping to the top left of
 the screen when backspacing.

(09-04-92)
  Did some more code optimizing. The same door used below in v1.9 now compiles
 to 117,476 for an additional reduction of 8K in the .EXE!

  You should also notice a tremendous increase in the display speed. Using
 a test program that printed 18 lines and contained the color codes around
 each word, it took 24.50 seconds for v3.4 to finish. Version 3.5 did it in
 7.69 seconds. That's a speed increase of about 319%!

  Added 2 new routines to the library. ClrMol clears in the middle of a line
 for the number of specified columns. ClrSol clears from the specified X, Y
 coordinates to the start of that line.

(09-03-92)
  Re-paged the docs to a maximum of 60 lines per page for laser printers.

Version 3.4
-----------
(08-27-92)
  Did some more optimizing of the code so your .EXE files should be a bit
 smaller than with v3.3.  One of my doors compiled to 127,244 with v3.3 and
 125,510 with v3.4, so it knocked almost 2K off the final .EXE!

  Fixed a problem which, in certain instances, would generate a 'Time
 Expired' message when the local display was toggled off (F9).

(08-24-92)
  Added a bunch more routines from Hanlin's PBClone library. I'll leave you
 the fun of discovering which ones. <G>

  Deleted the BIOSINKEY and KEYPRESS routines since they are local keyboard
 only routines.

Version 3.3
-----------
(06-21-92)
  Added support for TriBBS software. DoorFrame both reads and writes the
 TRIBBS.SYS file.

(06-15-92)
  Added a new Back.Space routine. Syntax is: Back.Space Row%, Col%, Num%
 Give it the row, column, and number of backspaces, the cursor will be
 positioned at the last backspace so if the Col% = 20 and Num% = 5, the
 cursor is left at column 16 (columns 20, 19, 18, 17, and 16 are erased).

Version 3.2
-----------
(06-03-92)
  Fixed an oversight dealing with the TimeAdjust% variable. The problem wasn't
 with the variable itself but rather with the frequency of updating the Status
 line (which was every 30 seconds). Now it will update after each Dis.Play
 statement. So if you are adjusting the callers time right before leaving the
 door, just Dis.Play a space or something immediately after using TimeAdjust%.

(05-24-92)
  Added the 'Last New Files Date' variable for those systems using Wildcat!'s
 USERINFO.DAT. The variable name is LastScan$

(05-20-92)
  Finally added a feature that has been sorely needed. You may now run your
 doors from the DOS command line. Syntax is MYDOOR LOCAL. DoorFrame will plug
 in enough dummy variables to enable it to run without using a BBS file.
 Since the .CFG file will not be opened when using LOCAL, you should bypass 
 any access to the .CFG file. If you MUST read additional lines from the .CFG
 then I would suggest not using the LOCAL option.

(05-12-92)
  Fixed a bug in the In.Put routine. Seems that the ASCII (or extended) SHIFT
 code for H, K, M, and P are the same as the scan codes for the arrows! So it
 was interpreting those 4 letters as arrow codes instead of the correct letter
 codes. The routine now checks the value of SysopKeys% to determine if it is
 a letter or an arrow. If SysopKeys% = 0, it's a letter, if SysopKeys% = 1,
 it's an arrow. This means you must only set SysopKeys% = 1 when you want to
 use the arrow keys since those 4 letters will also be interpreted as arrow
 keys. If you are expecting alphabetic input, you will get some strange
 results!

(05-11-92)
  Thought I had fixed it so no beeps were heard on the local but not so. It
 is fixed now, fer sure, fer sure!

(05-09-92)
  Learned what the Extra Time field was for in SFDOORS.DAT (thanks Chuck).
 Now if you utilize the TimeAdjust% variable, the Extra Time field in 
 SFDOORS.DAT will be adjusted up or down accordingly.

  Found out that Wildcat! looks for an Error Level of 1 when recycling so
 DoorFrame now generates a DOS error level of 1 when running under Wildcat!
 systems and error level 62 for all others (for now!).

(05-05-92)
  DoorFrame will now generate a DOS error level of 62. I understand that
 GAP systems can use this to correctly recycle the BBS whenever someone logs
 off from inside a door. Need some feedback on other systems please. 

  Added a couple of needed variables that were omitted when writing the
 PCBoard USERS.SYS file. The descrepancy would only show up when logging
 off from within a door but the time used and last date on were not being
 updated.

(05-02-92)
  Think I finally came up with a workable solution to get rid of the TIMER
 routines which drives a math coprocessor up the wall. The trade-off is that
 the status line will only be updated whenever input is required from the
 caller.
 
Version 3.1
-----------
(04-29-92)
  Included with this version is the .BAS source for a door called DFDEMO. It
 demonstrates some of the features of DoorFrame.  You may also want to use
 it to pick up some tips on using some of the routines.  The EXINPUT.BAS and
 DISPLAY.BAS files have been removed.

(04-27-92)
   Took me a whole day's work, but I dood it!  You may now use the color
 codes as often as you wish when Dis.Playing a line. In addition the colors
 and blinking are each independent of each other, so you can blink one, some,
 all, or none! The % turns on the blinking for each set of codes.

  Added a parameter to the ClrScrn routine. You may now clear the local and
 remote screen in any background color you wish (0 - 7).

  Did a bit more optimizing of the code and even with the new stuff added,
 was able to reduce the size of .LIB by over 5K!   

(04-24-92)
  In an effort to cut down on the number of variables we have to deal with
 (and hopefully cut down on memory requirements), I have combined the various
 system variables (Pcboard%, WildCat%, etc.) into one. System.File% will take
 their place. The value of System.File% will tell you which BBS file is being
 used according to the following values:
     1 = PCBOARD.SYS            2 = USERS.SYS           3 = DOOR.SYS
     4 = CALLINFO.BBS           5 = CHAIN.TXT           6 = DORINFOx.DEF
     7 = SFDOORS.DAT            8 = USERINFO.DAT        9 = GTUSER.BBS

  Deleted the Num.Dl.Today% variable. Use DlToday& instead.

(04-23-92)
  Have been receiving reports of an Error 6 (overflow) when using DoorFrame
 doors with the latest version of Spitfire.  Have been trying to locate an
 actual SFDOORS.DAT file. Finally one of my users uploaded one to me (thanks
 Aldo!). Lo and behold in the Downloads Per Day field there was 54,730! 
 So to stave off any more problems like this, I have changed the DlPerDay%,
 DlToday%, Downloads%, and Uploads% from INTEGER to LONG INTEGER.

  Used that extra space from the ON KEY and added support for GT Power's
 GTUSER.BBS file. The .CFG file for this one is a little different.  Since
 the file doesn't provide the COM port or Node numbers, they must be added on
 lines 5 and 6 of the .CFG file.

(04-22-92)
  Been reading how the ON KEY statement adds a lot of overhead to QB programs
 so have been researching how to get rid of them. Lo and behold, I found this
 neat little routine to do just that!  So all the ON KEY (and the associated
 KEY statements) are gone.  This change also knocked almost 2K off the size
 of the library.

Version 3.0
-----------
(04-20-92)
   Added the PCBoard Language extension parameter, LANGUAGE$, at the request
 of one of our European users. (Thanks Peter!) This variable will contain the
 extension of the language file, i.e.  .FRE for the French language. When
 using the default language (whichever one that is), this variable will
 contain 4 spaces.

(04-17-92)
  Added two new parameters to the BOX.IT routine. HFG% and HBG% now let's
 you specify the foreground and background colors when using a Title$ on
 your boxes.  Also added a check to see if Title$ is longer than the box.
 This would generate an Illegal Function error previously. Your Title$ must
 be at least 6 characters less than the width of the box. If it is longer
 than that, the routine simply ignores the Title$.

Version 2.9
-----------
(04-10-92)
  Made some small changes in reading the PCBoard USERS file (nothing major).
 Noticed that the callers first name variable was missing from DOOR.SYS,
 USERINFO.DAT etc. so those have been added.

(04-04-92)
  Fixed a small error in the SEND command when displaying an ASCII file.
 Seems it was reading from one file number and looking for the end of 
 another which would either not display all the file or generate an INPUT
 PAST END error.

(03-29-92)
  Reports have been surfacing from 486 owners concerning some possible
 incompatibilities with the math coprocessors in those machines. Starting
 with this version I am attempting to eliminate all floating point 
 operations. Therefore all Single Precision (!) and Double Precision (#)
 numbers have been changed to Long Integers (&). This mainly affects the
 Hi.Score# variable and the various Upload/Download variables.  So if you use
 any of these variables in your doors, you will need to change them.

Version 2.8
-----------
(03-21-92)
  DoorFrame doors may now make use of the IRQ environment variable. For
 example, instead of DOOR DOOR.CFG /5 you can use DOOR DOOR.CFG /%IRQ%

(03-19-92)
  DoorFrame is now aware of the PCBoard environment variables %PCBDRIVE% and
 %PCBDIR%. Although it is tranparent to you, the programmer, if it finds
 those two variables on the first line of the .CFG file it will substitute
 the correct drive and path.
  Also fixed a small bug with the time remaining when using USERS.SYS. 

Version 2.7
-----------
(03-07-92)
  Fixed a small problem with the high score bulletin. If the bulletin was in
 other than the current directory, the path for the graphics bulletin got
 screwed up.

  Added a new variable - Hi.Ascii% which allows you to accept ASCII values
 from 128 to 255. This was added at the request of one of our European users
 since some languages need to use those characters.  Hi.Ascii% = 1 will enable
 this option. The default is zero (disabled).

Version 2.6
-----------
(02-23-92)
  One more time on the SEND routine! I was checking the first few characters
 of a file for the CHR$(27) and if found just assumed that the file was all
 ANSI. Not so! Seems there are 'hand-made' files out there that have the
 color codes at the beginning of a line but no where else. So...... redid it
 one more time (hopefully the last!).

(02-21-92)
  Optimized the code a bit and moved some routines from the main module to
 the library.  Tested with just a two-line program and the size of the .EXE
 went from 103,434 before optimizing to 81,310 after optimizing.  So that
 should cut down on your file sizes a bit!

(02-17-92)
  NOTE: The parameters for the SEND routine have changed with this version!
 The new syntax is SEND FileName$, YN%, Clr%  where Clr% is 0 (home cursor,
 do not clear screen) or 1 (yes, clear screen).
  Added a bunch more routines for programmer use. See the enclosed
 PBC-SUBS.DOC for those.

Version 2.5
-----------
(02-14-92)
  Added a new routine, ClrEOL. This one will clear to the end of the line.
 You can specify where to start clearing. Example:  ClrEOL 10, 10, 1
 will do it's thing on row 10 and clear from column 10 to the end of the line
 and color it blue. The parameters are Xpos, Ypos, Color. Enjoy!
  Fixed a stupid mistake in the SEND routine. I open CONS: for printing to
 the local screen and misspelled it CON! Funny thing is, it worked except 
 when accessing across a network!
  Added GetDView which returns the version of DESQview loaded or zeroes if
 DESQview is not loaded.

(02-10-92)
  Think I finally got that pesky bug in the SEND routine when sending ANSI
 screens fixed! Give it a workout and let me know if it screws up.
  One quirk I found when using The Draw was when I saved the screen with
 ALT-S it didn't transmit quite right. But when the same screen was saved
 using ALT-B, the screen transmitted perfectly. So I would suggest using
 ALT-B instead of ALT-S to save your ANSI screens.

(02-09-92)
  Had some reports of the Backspace locking systems in local mode. Did some
 checking in the routine and the only thing I could find that could possibly
 be the culprit was an IF NOT LocalUsr% statement. Since I have had some 
 problems with NOT in the past, I changed that statement to IF LocalUsr% = 0.
 Since I have been unable to duplicate the lockups on either of my systems,
 I will have to depend on those who have to try this version and see if it
 is fixed. Thanks in advance to those who respond!
  BTW, new BBS number and address with this version.

Version 2.4
-----------
(10-25-91)
  Changed the second parameter on the IN.PUT routine from an integer to a
 single precision number. This allows you to specify a waiting time of less
 than 1 second. The minimum wait is now 1/18th of a second (.005 works
 pretty well).

(10-05-91)
  Fixed an oversight in writing the Wildcat! 3.x USERINFO.DAT. Line 16
 (DoorLogoff$) will now show "Y" if the caller logged off from the Door.

(09-08-91)
  You may now use the ARROW keys. DoorFrame now has an alternate set of keys
 for the Level and Time adjustments. To switch these keys from the ARROW keys
 to the alternate, use Sysopkeys% = 1 AFTER you call INITIALIZE. When you
 have SysopKeys% set to 1, PgUp = add time, PgDn = subtract time, INSert =
 add level, and DELete = subtract level. SysopKeys% defaults to 0 so doors
 compiled with previous versions of DoorFrame will work as before.
  When SysopKeys% = 1 pressing one of the arrow keys will return the
 following in RESPONSE$:
    Up Arrow    - RESPONSE$ = "UP"
    Dn Arrow    - RESPONSE$ = "DOWN"
    Left Arrow  - RESPONSE$ = "LEFT"
    Right Arrow - RESPONSE$ = "RIGHT"

  Would you believe I left out the code for low-intensity white in the
 DIS.PLAY routine! It has been added. (Thanks to Jerry Claxton for finding
 that one!)
  Added the ability to use low intensity colors when using the symbols in
 the DIS.PLAY routine. To make a color low intensity just put a * in front
 of the first symbol. Ex: *}text} displays 'text' in low intensity white.

(08-30-91)
  Changed the EXIT.DOOR "G" routine to allow logoffs on all systems, not just
 PCBoard.
  Changed the WildCat! 3.0 routines so that it DOES NOT automatically write
 the USERINFO.DAT file. If you wish to write this file, set User.Info = 1
 before calling EXIT.DOOR.

Version 2.3 
-----------
(06-20-91)
  Added support for WildCat! v3.0. This version of WildCat! no longer uses the
 CALLINFO.BBS file. It now uses the 31-line version of DOOR.SYS and creates an
 additional file called USERINFO.DAT. 

(7-07-91)
  They finally woke up at Mustang! Software and are now using the standard
 52-line DOOR.SYS like everyone else. This release adjusts for that. Just put
 the path to USERINFO.DAT on line 1 of the .CFG file (instead of DOOR.SYS).
 Make sure that DOOR.SYS is in the same directory as USERINFO.DAT!

Version 2.2
-----------
(03-31-91)
  Added support for non-standard IRQ numbers (other than IRQ3/IRQ4). See the
 docs for info on how to implement this.

Version 2.1 (03-23-91)
----------------------
  Modified the LINES routine. Now if you draw intersecting vertical and
 horizontal lines, the appropriate character will be inserted where the
 lines cross. For example, at the intersection of two double lines the
 character Î would be printed.
  Tweaked the MORE routine a little. It was doing a CR/LF after the prompt
 so it wasn't getting erased because it was on the line above!
  Also put in logic in the MORE and ENTER routines to restore the cursor to
 it's position before the call.
  Fixed a problem in DORINFOx.DEF where the Sysop names where being taken
 from DORINFO instead of the configuration file. Also allowed for the fact
 that the RBBS DORINFO has 13 lines instead of 12.
  Still didn't have the DORINFOx.DEF quite right for RBBS. Hopefully it will
 work as it should now (helps when you use the correct LINE INPUT statement).
  One more time on DORINFO to fix the BBSSYS$. Also fixed a problem in
 picking up the correct node number.

Version 2.0 (02-02-91)
----------------------
  Fixed a problem with the backspace when the cursor was in columns 79 or
 80 (it wouldn't).
  Enlarged the PRINT USING in the High Score Bulletin. It will now handle
 scores up to 9,999,999,999.
  Made DoorFrames internal error trapping available for those of you who
 wish to utilize it instead of writing your own. All Basic errors are
 trapped and will be written to DFRAME.ERR upon exiting the door.
  Added support for WWIV's CHAIN.TXT file. DoorFrame both reads and writes
 this file. It is untested as of this writing so watch it!
  Added 2 more parameters to the IN.PUT routine. These are INTEGERS and
 indicate the foreground and background colors for the input.
  Updated the CALLINFO.BBS routine to read the newer 36 line format. It
 will still handle the old 30 line format ok.
  Added a parameter to the SHOW.BLT routine. This is a STRING and is
 either "Y" or "N". The "Y" tells the routine to display the "Do you want
 to see the Bulletin" prompt while "N" will bypass the prompt. If you have
 an option on your door menu to view the bulletin, you would use "N" (why
 ask them again!).

Version 1.9 (12-31-90)
----------------------
  Fixed a bug when using the `, @, {, ^ etc. symbols. If one of these
 symbols was entered at an IN.PUT prompt, the program would go bananas.
  I had inadvertantly left out the ENTER prompt at the end of the SEND
 routine so when someone brought it to my attention I belated added it.
 Now I find that is the way some of you want it! So in order to satisfy
 both camps, I have added a parameter to SEND. The syntax is now:
   SEND (MSG$, YN%)   where YN% is an INTEGER. 0 = don't send the ENTER
 prompt at the end, 1 = yes, use it. 
  Added support for Spitfire's SFDOORS.DAT. DoorFrame both reads and writes
 to this file.
  Added the ability to log off from within the Door. However, this option is
 for PCBoard systems only!
  Added MAKE.BLT.CURRENT routine which posts current scores instead of the
 highest scores attained.
  Fixed a bug in the MAKE.BLT routines. It didn't take kindly to an extension
 being included in the Bulletin filename!

                         AND THAT'S IT FOR THIS YEAR!!

Version 1.8 (12-16-90)
----------------------
  Added a few more subroutines for programmer convenience. These routines
 will add some capabilities not found in QuickBasic. Routines added are:
   DelFile, DrvSpace, GetDrv, GetExecPath, GetKbd, GetSub, NameCase,
   RInstr, SetError, SetKbd and SubExist.
  Fixed a problem with the ALLOWEDBYTES# variable (helps if you add it to
 the DFRAME.INC file!).

Version 1.7 (12-13-90)
----------------------
  Added support for PCBoard 14.5's USERS.SYS file! Since the bug reports
 had started slacking off, thought I would introduce a few more 8-).
  Added option for no border (spaces) in the BOX.IT routine.
  Forgot to add an ENTER prompt after the last page in the SEND routine. 
 Fixed now.
  Had some reports of Security Levels higher than 32,767 so the LEVEL
 variable has been changed from an INTEGER (%) to a LONG (&).
  Took the Time Left warnings out. They only messed up the screen! So if 
 you want to warn the caller when time gets low, you should check the
 TIMELEFT% variable and display a message accordingly. 

Version 1.6 (12-11-90)
----------------------
  Fixed a problem in the error handling routines. It will hopefully handle
 errors better now and exit gracefully.
  Fixed the 'keyboard timeout' problem when coming out of Chat mode.
  Fixed another Chat mode problem where the lines on the remote screen
 would overwrite when it reached line 23.
  Optimized the library a bit. Cut about 13K off the size of the .LIB.
  Added a check for DOS version. If the DOS version is less than 3.0 it
 will display an error message and exit (DOS 3.0+ is required because the
 files are opened in SHARED mode).

Version 1.5 (11-30-90)
----------------------
  Finally got the midnight time problem fixed where the caller would get a
 time expired message if he had logged on the BBS before midnight and 
 entered the door after midnight.
  Fixed an error when using DORINFOx.DEF. It worked fine as long as
 DORINFOx.DEF was the only thing there but went screwy if you threw a path
 at it.
  When I added the options for color in the middle of a line of text, I
 inadvertantly disabled the full-line blink. Now fixed.

Version 1.4 (11-25-90)
----------------------
  Added some enhancements to the DIS.PLAY routine. By using special symbols,
 selected text can be displayed in different colors (like BLUE, YELLOW, BLUE)
 without having to use 3 DIS.PLAY statements. See the DOCS and DISPLAY.BAS
 for a complete explanation.
  Added the MODE% variable. Previously if you used DETECT.ANSI, the caller
 would be switched to COLOR MODE automatically. With the MODE% variable, the
 color will be on or off depending on the caller's BBS setting.
  Modified the IN.PUT routine somewhat. It now requires 2 parameters to be
 passed. The first parameter is the desired length of the input and the 
 second is the length of time to wait for that input.

Version 1.3 (11-20-90)
----------------------
  Added a time limit option to the IN.PUT routine. See EXINPUT.BAS for
 and example on using it.
  Fixed an 'oversight' in the OUT.PUT routine. Completely left out updating
 the column position!
  Made a correction in the centering routine. Now when you use centering
 with a colored background, you don't get the colored line all the way
 across the screen! Also, if you do an IN.PUT after a center it will be
 properly positioned after the prompt instead of on the right edge.

Version 1.2 (11-17-90)
----------------------
  Made the Keyboard Timeout configurable by the programmer. Before calling
 INITIALIZE, populate TIMEOUT% with the number of seconds you want for
 input. If you do not specify a TIMEOUT%, it will default to 5 minutes.
 The minimum is 60 secs so anything less than that will be the default.
  Added support for DORINFOx.DEF which now gives us QBBS, RBBS, and
 Remote Access! (Note: This needs to be tested more. Any volunteers?)

Version 1.1 (11-12-90)
----------------------
  Fixed a problem with the cursor positioning routines when the local display
 was toggled off (it didn't work!).
  Changed the BOX subroutine to BOX.IT to avoid a naming conflict with other
 add-on packages for QB 4.5. (Crescent Software's for one).
  Added support for CALLINFO.BBS so your doors will now run on Wildcat! 
 systems without a converter!

Version 1.0 (11-1-90)
---------------------
Initialize release.
