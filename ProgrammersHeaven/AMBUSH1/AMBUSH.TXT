 Yes, the game that started it all, Ambush at South Range! Easily one of, 
if not THE, most creative QBasic game ever, Ambush at South Range is an 
addictive game that will keep you entertained for hours! Also difficult,
you can request strategies via email at the addresses below. In Ambush
at South Range, you plot to overtake the South Range middle school, and, in 
the ultimate battle, destroy Mr. Wuss himself. Ambush at South Range was
created in August of 1994, and at that time Molnar \ Kucalaba Productions
did not have half the understanding of the BASIC language that they do 
today, so we relied on our strong point: creativity. We hope you enjoy
Ambush at South Range, and by all means, email us!
