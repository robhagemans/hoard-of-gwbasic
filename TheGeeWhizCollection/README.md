> This entire collection is now available as FREEWARE.


Tom McIntire has had a distinguished career as a programmer, most of
which was concerned with creating business applications with GW-BASIC.
In the course of doing this, he developed many tools to make his work
easier and more efficient. He also collected over the years a great deal
of information that was not only vital to the GW-BASIC programmer, but
of use to almost any programmer. Here gathered together in one place is
the information, tools and some of the programs. Formerly Shareware, he
has kindly released them as Freeware.  

## PROGRAMS

##### WhizBLUE: A GW-BASIC language program editor & toolkit `whizblue`  
By the early 80's nearly all programming languages had "development
tools", utilities really, that made a programmer's job easier. At the
least, functions common to word processing were included in every
language's own editor. Things like cut and paste, and find and swap were
considered "basic". But, BASIC didn't have even those basics. So this
author made his own tools to help him write programs in GW-BASIC. By
1988 this set of tools had grown to the point it included several
functions not found packaged with the "superior languages" like PASCAL
and C. Check this out: Do Find and Swap on variable names. Cross
reference lists, too, for keywords, for line numbers, or for variables.
Ho hum, you say. How about this: A static code analyzer--the ultimate
quality assurance tool. And, even, a code generator that can mass
produce source code from lists of data. Yep, all of that is included in
this package, and it's all done in GW-BASIC. And it all still works, on
modern machines too, after all these years. Before you echo the popular
sentiment that GW-BASIC is too primitive, check out this package.  

##### WhizTool: GW-BASIC language programming tools `whiztool`
By the late sixties nearly all programming languages had symbolic-names
capability. And by then, all programmers knew the value of cross
referencing utilities--programs that could read their programs and
produce lists of the names they had invented, and where they were used.
When BASIC came along, its only intrinsic tools were a klutzy TRACE, and
RENUM. The lack of good tools was, in fact, one of the reasons most
"professional programmers" denigrated BASIC so much. This author--as did
many--simply designed his own tools. Later on, he packaged his tools
under a common cover, standardized their appearance, and wrote a
"manual" to go with them. Here they are now, for free, for use by anyone
programming in GW-BASIC. In fact, if you are programming in GWB, or
trying to patch or debug old GWB code, grab ahold of these gems. You
will be glad you did!  

##### WhizBAM: Basic language programming tools `whizbamx`
Sooner or later, all professional programmers go native on occasion.
Modern languages on today's machines often make it relatively easy to do
so. Ipso, most have a built-in capablity to switch over to assembler
language for a bit, then back again. In days of yore we BASIC
programmers were compelled to go native more often on those old, slow
machines, yet it was a bear to do. WhizBAM was this author's solution.
It is a "mini-assembler". And, more importantly, it outputs
syntactically clean lines of BASIC source code that can easily be merged
into end-use programs. WhizBAM itself is small, compact, and fast. Its
help manual covers all of the mechanics of imbedding machine language
code into the fabric of BASIC programs, and it covers the full spectrum
of how to CALL that code in GW-BASIC, and in most of the QBs of that
era. WhizBAM depends on having one of Microsoft's DEBUG programs
resident (either a COM or an EXE version will work.) Because WhizBAM has
to reroute "standard I/O", it is best run in a DOS environment, even on
a Windows machine. In any event, when you need to go native out BASIC,
WhizBAM is a slick way to do it.  

##### EBS: Screen editor for BLOAD pages `ebsx`  
By the time anyone has written three programs in BASIC they are tired of
the monotony of typing LOCATE/PRINT sequences. Right? EBS is a nifty way
to reduce that drudgery to zip, and make your programs smaller and
faster. EBS is an editor. A twenty-year old, text mode, screen editor.
Type all over the screen. Color whatever, with what ever color you want
to, then hit Save. EBS does a BSAVE of your layout. In your target
program, do a BLOAD. It is easy to do, and your pretty mask smacks the
glass instantly, even on old, slow PCs. And, by the way, this scheme
works equally well on new PCs running Windows. And the BLOAD trick works
with any BASIC that knows how to BLOAD. The average bear can master the
use of EBS in less than hour, and no bear likes having to type LOCATE
and PRINT a zillion times. Right?  

##### DataWhiz: GW-BASIC application tools `dwx`  
The world is full of Rolodex programs. Here is another one. Like others,
you can create "cards" with names, addresses, and phone numbers on them.
And, using this program, you can find cards fast, make changes to them,
delete obsolete ones, insert new ones, print lists and rosters, and even
print mailing labels. Wow and gee whiz! In less than ten minutes you can
probably find 50 different free programs on the Internet that will do
all of that and more. But... This program was invented before the
Internet, before we had megs of memory and gigs of disk space. In those
days things were often simpler, however. This program does not even use
a Mouse, for example. On the other hand, this program does all that is
needed to add, change, delete and list records in a small data base. And
it does it efficiently, with a pretty menu scheme, and built-in, on-line
help. And it is all done in BASIC, coded to make it easy to customize.
In short, if you need to build a custom data base program in a hurry,
start with this "core program". If you know GW-BASIC, you can be done
before sundown.  

##### WhizFont: GW-BASIC application tools `wfx.exe`
If you enjoy making animated GIFs you might get a kick out of this
package. See how with this software the author made icons that could
flip, and spin, and zip around all over the screen on old, slow XT's
with 640 memories. And, he did it in GW-BASIC, that old, slow,
primitive, kiddy language. A C++ guru once told this author, "you can't
do that in BASIC." The author's answer: "I can if I want to...it's my
computer!) And here is how he did it--the whole bag of tricks, including
the source code for the "editor", and a demo application. Yes, these
programs run on Windows machines, although, they tend to whiz a tad
faster than they used to. Having the source at hand, however, you are
welcome to slow them down, or patch them to suit yourself: You can if
you want to, on your own computer, gee whiz.  

##### WhizKids: GW-BASIC user application `wkx`  
Here is a program that appeals to tricycle motors, and their mothers.
WhizKids helps teach kids their ABCs and how to count. It is a
connect-the-dots program. All momma has to do is show her kids how to
use the arrow keys to pick the number or letter that comes next in
sequence. When the outline of a figure is completely drawn, their reward
is a pretty, full-colored overlay of their line drawing. This package
includes twenty pictures and a comprehensive how-to-do help program. And
for the dads, the source program itself is an interesting model of how
all of this could be done using that orphan of bygone days: GW-BASIC.  

##### WhizDraw: GW-BASIC user application `wdx`
This suite of programs evolved over several years. Version 1, called
QuickDraw, ran on a CGA machine about three months after the first CGAs
hit the street. Version 2, called Draw4, did its thing with a mouse, by
golly. When the EGA came along, version 3 soon followed and was called
WhizDraw. It reused some pixel punching routines from previous versions,
added many more, and supported HP's then top of the line ink jet
printer. Version 4, this one, dispensed with the shareware cloak and
squeaked through beta testing on Windows 95 and 98 machines. Here it is
now, WhizDraw for free, source and all. It is usable as is, of course,
but it can also be handy to have around as a library of compact
"graphics routines". If you need to make a 2-dimensional object flip,
spin, turn, or whatever, in a 4-plane, 16-color machine, look here
before wasting your brain power or your time reinventing the wheel.
Chances are, WhizDraw has already been there and done it in GW-BASIC,
gee whiz.  

##### WhizHelp: GW-BASIC application development tool `whx`  
Once upon a time, the books were bigger than the box. And publishing
costs for manuals often exceeded what it cost to develop the software
itself. Media costs, one of the main factors, gradually ebbed as discs
got bigger. The manuals became thinner as the space needed for "help"
files increased. On-line help schemes got better too as memory on PCs
increased. WhizHelp was this author's way of staying abreast of the
trends, and includes even, a means for doing "context sensitive" help.
In a sense, WhizHelp is a compiler. It reads your "text file manual",
and produces an on-line version of the file, and a customized display
program. It is a quick way to produce pretty fancy "help" systems. Read
the one packaged with this program and judge for yourself. And now it
can be done for your applications cheaper than ever before, because now
the tool is free.

##### WhizAct: GW-BASIC user application `wax`  
"Pegboard Accounting" was a popular scheme for small businesses in the
sixties. Then along came "bookkeeping machines". They were mechanical
beasts, usually about the size of a desk, and could only be moved with a
fork lift. In the seventies, NCR and Burroughs added "magnetic stripes"
to the edges of accounting ledgers and their new "electronic" accounting
machines were called "programmable." This author cut his professional
teeth programming those machines at night while working as a bookkeeper
during the day. With the advent of the PC, he used that hard-won
experience as the basis for writing an accounting package usable on
"desk top computers." Because it was all that was then available, his
language of choice was interpreted BASIC, of course. That was in 1975.
Although "modernized" several times over the next twenty years, his 1995
model included here has needed few changes since. And it is still in use
by a few folks, running as is, on modern Windows machines. Take a look
at its utter simplicity and see why it is still around, and how it was
possible for the author to design a program that is still usable a
quarter of a century later.  

##### Tricks: GW-BASIC code library `tricks`
No programmer enjoys having to reinvent the wheel. And most of us have a
folder where we save chunks of code that might come in handy again
someday. Here are 75 chunks of clean and lean code that can be cut and
pasted into nearly any BASIC language stream. They are all fall-through
algorithms (no branches). Need a sort routine? Shell, or bucket type?
Ascending, and descending, numeric and string arrays, and even bytes
within a string are covered in this set. And conversion routines for
dates and times. and BCD to binary, and hex to octal, and all the vice
versas you can think of. The BAS file is loadable by GWBASIC.EXE. The
DOC file is a fully indexed set for those using Windows based editors.
Take a look: Might be a trick or two here that can save you some time,
sometime, gee whiz.  

##### Patcher: GW-BASIC programming utility `patcher`  
Ever wonder who picked the default list of F-key macros built into
GW-BASIC? Sure, they can be changed to something more practical if you
want to. And if you want to, you have to do it again, and again, every
time you load the interpreter. Patcher.BAS will permanently solve that
problem for GWBASIC.EXE 3.23. Plus, if you want to, while you are at it,
you can also disable the tester that stops you from being able to LIST
or EDIT programs that were saved with the comma-P option. This is a
small tool, for sure, but a handy addition to any GW-BASIC sweat shop.  

##### LoanWhiz: GW-BASIC User Application `lwx`
This little program was a freebie given away with all WhizWare
accounting programs, as a door prize, to used car dealers, or anybody
else that wanted it. It is only natural then, that it should be made a
part of this collection. If you don't happen to have an amortization
program, put this one in your accessories bag. Use your car loan to test
its usefulness. In the event you don't like the result, get rid of the
car.  

##### GWscan: GW-BASIC Programming Utility `gwscanx`  
More basic than dirt for GW-BASIC programmers, GWscan is an absolute
must. This is the only known program other than GWBASIC.EXE that can
"detokenize" GW-BASIC programs. Thus, it is a must, because with it you
can do cut and paste operations from your library of GW-BASIC programs.
And you can do it via SHELL to the EXE version while still in editing
mode inside the interpreter. Plus, it can do even more. It can detect
and display different types of BSAVE files, and do hexadecimal screen
dumps, and do translations of binary INT, SNG, and DBL fields in data
files, and.... And today there is no reason for any GW-BASIC programmer
to have to do without it because GWscan is now as free as the breeze,
gee whiz.  

##### POSWhiz: GW-BASIC User Application `poswhiz`
POS = Point Of Sale, naturally. And here is an opportunity to get a few
more miles out of your old PC XT or AT: make a cash register out of it.
Although designed years ago for 8086 PC's, this software works amazingly
well on modern machines too. As is, it is tailored for a Mom and Pop
thrift store, but you do not have to be rocket scientist to tweak a bit
to suit most any small business. And it's free, including the source
code, so why not? Updated 5/15/04.  

##### WhizNews: GW-BASIC User Application `wnx`  
A WhizNews show consists of "screen pages". When the end of the show is
reached, it starts all over again. Screen pages are 40-characters wide
by 25 lines high. Words, lines, and characters on each page can be
"animated"…words can zoom up, shoot from the left, walk from the right,
or any of 26 "actions". WhizNews shows are, conceptually, "advertising
movies". If a viewer wants to know more about a certain subject, the
show can be interrupted and the system switches to a static
text-file-displaying program called WhizInfo. And included with all of
this is WNeditor, the program that makes it possible for you to create
shows of your own. If this sounds a bit like Power Point, it should…but
the original incarnation of WhizNews was born long before the birth of
Windows. And funnily enough, it is still fun, gee whiz, even when
running with Windows.  

##### WhizCall: GW-BASIC User Application `wcall`
WhizCall makes "chain-dialing" a whiz. Like when refilling medical
prescriptions by telephone. Like having to first dial up a robot, then
enter strings of digits for each pill bottle one at a time. This program
makes the connection then keeps the line open while you pick off
additional strings of numbers stored in its associated data file. Which
is, really, a handy phone number directory organized according to your
own preferences. As is, WhizCall is quick and easy to use. Even so, for
those who would rather that it worked differently, the program can be
changed. The built-in help file explains how the source program works so
that almost any BASIC programmer can customize it. And it works on
nearly any PC manufactured in the last 25 years, with almost any version
of DOS or Windows. And it's all free, gee whiz.  

## GAME PROGRAMS

##### SoliDOS: GW-BASIC game program `solidosx`  
Like Minnie might say, Mickey is only good for some things. Tom thinks
the same way. A lot of programs would be better off without a mouse.
Ever watch a bookkeeper's fingers tap dance on an adding machine? Those
so disposed will like SoliDOS--you can play Solitaire all day without
raising your hand off the 10-key pad. And, although this program is less
than two years old, notice it too is written in GW-BASIC. Those who
think GWB is a dead language ought to take a look at this program, gee
whiz.  

##### PopOff: GW-BASIC game program `popoff`
Some folks like to play computer games. The author of this one enjoys
playing them only occasionally. As it is for many programmers, to him,
writing game programs is a lot more fun than playing with the result.
And a quick look at how this one works makes it obvious the author had a
lot of fun building it.  

##### Simon  #: GW-BASIC game program `simonx`
Remember the battery-powered Simon game of just a few years ago? Here is
another computerized look-alike. This one, unlike most, however, is
played with the cursor arrow keys rather than a mouse. This one is
unique in another important way: It was written in GW-BASIC, gee whiz.
And although the game is for kids, and it seems simple enough, the
design of this program is a tad more than trivial.  

##### Troika: GW-BASIC Game Program `troikax`
The author learned from a crossword puzzle one time that a troika is a
team of horses aligned three abreast. Then one night a few months ago,
while surfing for something else, a game called Candy looked
interesting. And it was, but it also had a couple of bad bugs. So, here
is a take-off from that basic idea with a few custom twists. Not only
that, it will run on nearly any DOS or Windows machine. Give it a try,
and when you've tired of it, give it to the grandkids. That's what
WhizCat did, by golly.  

##### WhizPix: GW-BASIC User Application `whizpix`
GW-BASIC and DOS grew up together, but their step-daddy abandoned them
when souped-up CPU's and zigabyte disks came along. Yet, so far anyway,
we can still run GW-BASIC on most Windows machines. And although
GWBASIC.EXE never matured beyond SCREEN 9 (640x350, and 16 colors), with
just a little effort it is possible to do some pretty pretty things. And
this do-it-yourself kit reduces that effort to a fun level. The GW-BASIC
programs in this kit can display Windows BMP files, convert BMP files to
BSAVE files, and enlarge displayed text. And just for the fun of it,
another one contains a dozen animated graphics routines.  

##### Arrows: GW-BASIC Game Program `arrowsx`
The author's grandkids tire of playing the "same old games", so they
say. So, from time to time, WhizCat invents a new one. Sort of, that is.
What he really does is, he roams the Internet looking for game ideas.
Then when one piques his interest, he writes his own rendition. Arrows
came to be, in exactly that manner. It is a grid game in which you move
blocks with a mouse, and achieving high scores depends on both a little
luck, and fair amount of mental acuity. As merely a game, it is fun. As
a model of how to write games for contemporary computers in GW-BASIC,
this you have got to see. And for free, why not, gee whiz?  

##### Flipper: GW-BASIC Game Program `flipperx`  
WhizCat found a freeware game called Zondulux, liked the idea, but not
the implementation. So, as most any programmer will do, he wrote his own
rendition. Game is played by flipping tokens on a grid, hence the name,
Flipper. Actually, this flipping game is a brain busting puzzle with
four skill levels. The kinder crowd can soon master the easy one. Mensa
majors can solve the fourth level, maybe. The author could not, however,
so the program also includes a DEMO mode to prove that all puzzles
really can be solved. And the source program proves that GW-BASIC can be
used to produce pretty games. Perhaps after seeing it, you will agree,
gee whiz.  

##### Search: GW-BASIC Game Program `searchx`  
You too have probably seen "Word Find" books near those containing
crossword puzzles in the stores. Perhaps you also enjoy finding the
words interlaced among the randomized gibberish of letters arranged in
grids on page after page. My Search program is an e-game of similar ilk.
It has eighteen categories of word lists, thirty-six words per group
that can each be displayed in eight different grids. Yes, that equates
to 144 different puzzles...and a gross is a bunch, by golly. And for
those so disposed, Search can be a gross of fun, gee whiz.  

##### Robo Rat: GW-BASIC Game Program `roboratx`  
RoboRat was first thought of as Robot Rat. The first SAVE had a typo in
it making the nickname Robo seem like an inspired invention. So be it.
Robo likes cheese, but being dumb like a robot, you have to aim him at
bites scattered about on the playing board. Game ends if you aim him
wrong and he scoots off into nowhere. Or, when he has eaten all of the
pieces on the board, you start another round. A little too trivial for
the NASA crowd, perhaps, but kids love it, and some parents do to. If
you happen to get caught playing it you can always respond that you were
merely curious about how WhizCat did what he did in GW-BASIC. Which is
why he did it, by the way, to prove to himself that it could be done,
gee whiz.  

##### Funnel of Fun: GW-BASIC Game Program `funnelx`  
Funnel of fun it was indeed. There is always something that makes every
game program a little different from others on the inside. In this case,
that twenty percent or so that was not humdrum had to do with
dynamically redisplaying the jumble of balls remaining up in the cone of
the funnel after one drops out of the spout. The player's challenge is
in deciding where on the grid to place each one so that no two of the
same color are adjacent. Turns out, it was more of a challenge than
first reckoned--both the programming, and how to win a round now and
then. Dissecting it, or playing it, perhaps you too will agree that
there is fun in this Funnel.  

##### 5starZ: GW-BASIC Game Program `5starzx`  
Several board games similar to 5starZ can be found on the net. This gem
is a hybrid of couple of the better ones with some added twists. The
modern ones all gobble a meg or two or three, naturally. Although
5starZ.EXE is a mere 79kb or so, and not as fancy as some, it will run
on most any old EGA/VGA machine with DOS 4.0 and later, and all versions
of Windows up through 98 SE, at least. Small, quick, addictive, and
absolutely free, including source code and all. See it at WhizWare World
soon. WhizCat likes it, of course, and somebody you know might too, gee
whiz.  

##### PyraDOS: GW-BASIC Game Program `pyradosx`  
Like Minnie might say, Mickey is only good for some things. This author
thinks the same way. A lot of programs would be better off without a
mouse. Ever watch a bookkeeper's fingers tap dance on an adding machine?
Those so disposed will like PyraDOS--you can play Pyramid Solitaire all
day using just the keyboard. And, although this program is less than a
year old, notice it too is written in GW-BASIC. Functionally, it is
similar to SoliDOS, q.v. Those who think GW is a dead language ought to
take a look at this program, gee whiz.  

##### Bomber: GW-BASIC Game Program `BomberX`  
Although this game is a bit juvenile, turns out it is harder to get a
perfect score than first supposed. Secondly, Bomber serves as an example
of how to do simple animations of homemade sprites. This program also
demonstrates a clever method for automatically achieving consistent
movement speeds on any platform. So far, this has been true anyway, for
DOS 3.0 up through Windows 98, on old XT's plodding along at 4.5 MHz,
and newer ones running as fast as 1.2 GHz. That it also performs the
same, unchanged, as a BAS or EXE tends to prove that GW-BASIC is not
quite dead yet, gee whiz.  

##### SpidosDOS: GW-BASIC Game Program `SpiDOSx`  
Like Minnie might say, Mickey is only good for some things. This author
said so also, twice before. A lot of programs would be better off
without a mouse. Like SoliDOS and PyraDOS, SpiDOS is played from the
keyboard. Ever watch a bookkeeper's fingers tap dance on an adding
machine? Those so disposed will like SpiDOS--you can play Spider
Solitaire all day without groping for your mouse. And, although this
program is brand new, notice it too is written in GW-BASIC. Those who
think GWB is a dead language ought to take a look at this program that
can run on most any DOS or Windows computer. The EXE version was
compiled using the GW-BASIC source as input to QuickBASIC. And it's all
free, the GW and the QB program, gee whiz.
