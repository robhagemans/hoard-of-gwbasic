  WhizTool is our "catch all name" for this collection of five programs  and
  the accompanying on-line user's manual, i.e., this program.

  WhizTool.COM is the program that displays the manual, WhizTool.DAT.

  Mouse lovers:  This program checks to see if MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS has
  already been loaded.  If not, or Mickey is napping, this program simply
  reverts to no-Mouse mode.  (Use the cursor arrow keys instead.)

    Also:  Only one of two buttons are tested for; the left one works like
    <Enter> and the right one like <Esc>.

  The five tool programs all have a file extension of dot-BAS; they are all
  stored in ASCII format (they were saved using the comma-A option on SAVE).
  Thus:  The tools themselves are "mergeable modules"--they are made use of
  by merging them into end product programs during their development.  Then,
  typically, they are deleted.  Because they are all numbered alike they can
  also overlay each other.  Read on ....
|Overall

  The overall design:  These programs are meant to be added on to the tail-end
  of a program already loaded into memory.  The tools that analyze program
  lines then "read" from the first line of the real program, stopping when
  line 9000 is reached so that the tool itself is not included in the output.

  To know when to stop depends on two things:  The interpreter has a work
  area word that it keeps updating with the line number of the currently
  executing line.  When we RUN or GOTO the first line of a tool, logic on
  that line saves its own line number.  (So that if the program or the tool
  is renumbered, the tool can take care of itself.)

  RUN is used to start the static code analyzers-- ùLXREF ùVFIND ùVXREF --
  because RUN lets the tool program itself build a new stack of variables of
  its own.  (So the tool and the real program make use of the same memory.)
  GOTO is used to start the dynamic tools-- ùLHITS ùVLIST --so that the
  interpreter's work areas are still intact at the time the tool is started.

  The internal logic of each program depends on a specific awareness of how
  GWBASIC.EXE works.  That knowledge is thoroughly documented in ùGeeWhiz --
  the on-line language reference manual also available from ùWhizWare
                                                            (continued)
| 

  Parsing along a line:  A 255-byte string is used to hold codes--pointers
  for an ON GOTO, to a piece of logic that can handle a particular type of
  byte that might be encountered.  This driver-string is constructed in a file
  buffer so that it is external to the interpreter's dynamic management of
  variables.  A series of POKE statements is done during start-up to insert
  GOTO codes into these bytes appropriate to the needs of each tool.

  Parsing of variables:  The GOTO codes are set up to "step over" numeric
  words, key word tokens, quoted strings and most other can't-be-a-name
  bytes.  Any byte in the decimal range of 65-90 (ASCII caps A-Z) is thus the
  first byte of a name.  Maybe.  A test string is built of this first letter,
  plus those that follow and any character from the set "0123456789.!#$%(".
  This suspect must then be compared to the "untokenized" key words list to
  decide whether it should be reported or not.

    Note:  Nearly all key words in the language are stored as tokens (codes).
    Nine words are not, however.  They are stored as ASCII caps-strings.  They
    are ACCESS, ALL, APPEND, AS, BASE, OUTPUT, RANDOM, SEG, and SHARED.  Also,
    the letter-switches B, and BF are peculiar.  When used with graphics LINE
    statements they are differentiated from variables based on how they are
    used "in context".  See ùLimitations for more about these turkeys.
|How

  All five of these tools are unique in what they can be useful for, but they
  are highly similar in how to make use of them.

  They all begin at line 9000 and were saved with the A-for-ASCII option on
  SAVE so they can be merged into a program already in memory.  And they can
  overlay each other.  They can be gotten rid of by a simple DELETE 9000-.

  Two or more of these tools can be in memory at once by merging-in one, then
  renumbering it to begin at, say, 7000.  (Assuming enough memory, of course.)
  They can be left in during development, and be used repeatedly at various
  times, as well.

  Output is normally to the screen, but PRINT can be easily changed to LPRINT
  statements if desired.  Obviously they can be further customized, also, but
  specific knowledge of how GWBASIC.EXE works is needed.  Again, that detail
  is thoroughly documented in ùGeeWhiz --the on-line language reference
  manual also available from ùWhizWare
|When

  Each of these tool programs were devised for solving certain types of
  programming "problems".  Some typical cases are listed below.

  Need to coin a new variable?  Run VFIND to check to see if a prospective
  name has already been used.

  Want to change the name of an existing variable?  Run VFIND to get a list
  of all of the line numbers that name exists in.

  If a variable's contents is other than what you expected at a point, use
  VXREF.  Check the lines that contain that variable.  And check those for
  other variables that have similarly spelled names; maybe a typo is all that
  is wrong.

  Logic-flow problems can nearly always be solved by using the output from
  LXREF, tediously tracking all branching activity, one line at a time.  This
  is a "static" exercise however.  Sometimes a dynamic approach will take less
  time.  Run a program to a point--maybe until a temporarily inserted STOP
  statement.  Check the output from LHITS to see if a particular branch has
  occurred, i.e., the target line number of a GOTO, GOSUB, THEN, etc.  LHITS
  is especially handy for debugging event traps like ON TIMER, or on COM(n).

                                                           (continued)

  The most common use of VLIST is for performance optimization.  Every time a
  variable is encountered during execution the interpreter must run through its
  index of names already assigned.  It does it from the top down, one name at
  a time, every time.  We can shorten this search "overhead" by stacking names
  in a deliberate order, forcing the most frequently used names to be near the
  top of the index.  (Names are added to the index when an area of memory must
  be allocated to hold their contents; each new name gets added to the bottom
  of the list.)  VLIST lists the variable names index at any given point in
  time.  This is an easier solution to the problem than trying to anticipate
  exactly which types of statements cause names to be added to the index.
  (Some manuals say that names are added by any first-using statement; that is
  an erroneous, over-simplification.  The exceptions list is considerable.)

  Quality checks:  Compare the output from VLIST and VXREF, for example.  The
  first reports variables actually used, the second lists all names imbeded in
  the program.  Names reported by VXREF but not by VLIST ought to be examined.
  On the one hand, that area of code was never executed (but maybe it should
  have been).  Another possibility:  In the case, for example, OOPS is listed
  by VXREF, but not by VLIST, check those lines.  If you see something like
  IF OOPS=15 THEN, then the question arises, was OOPS ever assigned a value
  in the first place? 
|Limitations

  These tools are extremely version-sensitive--currently coded to suit
  GWBASIC.EXE Version 3.23, specifically.  They "read" a program as it is 
  stored in memory, in so called tokenized form.  Although most of the tokens
  and other internal codes and data formats have remained much the same over
  the last several years, working storage areas used by the interpreter tend
  to "move" with each successive release and new versions.  Thus:  If these
  tools do not work correctly it is most likely because of internal addressing
  differences, i.e., the interpreter in question is not version 3.23.

  All of these programs were written very compactly to cause the least space
  impact while merged-in with an end product program under development.  The
  coding style they exhibit is not meant to be pretty; they are dense so as to
  achieve optimum performance during their use.

  Their "crash handling" logic is equally simplistic:  Let the interpreter
  take care of it.  If ERR=7 or ERR=9, design capacity limits have been
  exceeded.

         See the next page for some specific limits and "exceptions" ....
| 

      tool        static size        run space needed
     ùLHITS          839 bytes          8100 bytes
     ùLXREF          823                8100
     ùVFIND          939               <100
     ùVLIST          690               <100
     ùVXREF         1775                3500 plus 3 for each unique name

  LHITS and LXREF provide for a maximum of 999 references.  ERR=9 if more
  than that are encountered.

  VXREF works for up to 255 unique names.  ERR=9 if more are found.

  If LHITS or LXREF or VXREF run out of memory, ERR=7 will be reported.

  VFIND treats "untokenized" key words as if they were variables, thus, SEG
  can be found as if it were a variable name.  Also, searches for names B
  or BF will also produce line numbers containing LINE statements that use
  these argument "codes".

  VLIST uses an array called O!--it too will be shown in the output report
  (as the last one named if your program does not have a similarly named one).

                                                           (continued)

  All of these tools suppose the program being analyzed is free of simple
  syntax errors.  If a tool hangs, or crashes, or produces bad output it may
  well be because it bumped into unexpected "junk".

  Yes, it would be possible to "improve" them so they would not suffer from
  the limitations listed above.  But, they would be bigger.  And slower.  And
  a lot more complicated.  So:  They are the way they are on purpose.  We use
  them daily in our shop just as you see them here.  They work quite well for
  us because some of our conventions obviate their limitations ....

    No program of ours ever has more than 255 unique variables (thirty or
    forty is typical of our largest ones).

    No program ever "branches" to more than 999 different lines (we do not
    write spaghetti-code).

    We never use O by itself as the name of a variable (to preclude eye-ball
    confusion with a zero).

    No program of ours uses line numbers ranging anywhere near 9000 (they
    are always numbered starting at 1000 and incremented by 10).  Obviously,
    you can renumber your tools to start higher, if you want to.
|LHITS

  LHITS ÄÄÄ Line Hits

  This tool will provide a list of line numbers that have been branched-to,
  and which lines referenced them, after a program has been run to some point.

  Example:  1130  1200, 2020, 3130

  Read as:  Line 1130 was referenced from within lines 1200, 2020, and 3130
            by a GOTO, GOSUB, THEN, ELSE, etc.

  To use LHITS merge it into your program.  RUN your program.  After an END,
  STOP, or Ctrl-Break, do a GOTO 9000.

  It is also possible to simply insert a GOTO 9000 at a strategic place in
  your program to invoke the tool automatically.

  Notice this is a dynamic (run-time-live) tool.  Compare with ùLXREF which
  is a static code analyzer.
|LXREF

  LXREF ÄÄÄ Lines Cross Reference

  This tool will provide a list of line numbers that are branched-to, and
  which lines contain those references.

  Example:  1130  1200, 2020, 3130

  Read as:  Line 1130 is referenced from within lines 1200, 2020, and 3130
            by a GOTO, GOSUB, THEN, ELSE, etc.

  To use LXREF merge it into your program then type RUN 9000.

  Be prepared to hit <Pause>--scrolling may occur if output is sent to the
  monitor.  (Only three PRINT statements need to be changed to send output to
  the system printer; they are at the very end of the tool program; LPRINT is
  an easy fix when you prefer this.)

  Notice this is a static code analyzer.  Compare with ùLHITS which is a
  dynamic tool--it only reports lines actually branched-to after a program
  has been run to some point.
|VFIND

  VFIND ÄÄÄ Variable Find

  This tool searches a program in memory and reports the line numbers of any
  line that contains a particular variable's name.

  Example:  Find X4

  Output:   2020  2040  3650

  Read as:  X4 is contained one or more times in each of the lines listed.

  To use VFIND merge it into your program then type RUN 9000.  After the
  prompt "Find", type the name of the variable to be searched for.

  Notes:  Lower case letters typed after Find will automatically be upshifted.
          Exact spellings are important; X4 is different than X4$.
          Array names should be typed like IR( --with left parenthesis only.
          To find function names include the FN.  Like FNC or FNC( or FNX$.
          Also, see ùLimitations about the special cases of names B and BF.
|VLIST

  VLIST ÄÄÄ Variables List

  This program prints the contents of the variables index as it has been
  constructed by the interpreter--the names are ordered as they were added
  to the index since the last RUN was done.

  To use VLIST merge it into your program.  Run your program and exercise most
  of its routines.  After an END, or STOP, or Ctrl-Break, type GOTO 9000.

  It is also possible to simply insert a GOTO 9000 at a strategic place in
  your program to invoke the tool automatically.

  Notice this is a dynamic (run-time-live) tool.  Compare with ùVXREF which
  is a static code analyzer.

  Output from this tool reflects the data type of each variable, regardless
  of whether or not those appendages ($%!#) were included within program
  statements themselves.  Also, this program uses an array called O!( --if
  your program did not use this name, this one will be listed as the last one
  added to the index.
|VXREF

  VXREF ÄÄÄ Variables Cross Reference

  This program prints an alphabetized listing of all variables named in a
  program.  Each name is followed by the line numbers of lines containing one
  or more of those references.

  To use VXREF merge it into your program then type RUN 9000.

  Be prepared to hit <Pause>--scrolling may occur if output is sent to the
  monitor.  (If you prefer printer output, scan the program for PRINT commands
  and change them to LPRINT.)

  Notice this is a static code analyzer.  Compare with ùVLIST which is a
  dynamic tool--it only reports the names of variables actually encountered
  after a RUN has been done to some point.  (And that tool does not list any
  line numbers.)

  Also:  This program treats names like X4 and X4$ as distinct, based on how
  they are stated in programming expressions.  Whereas they may in fact be
  treated the same by the interpreter -- and ùVLIST -- as would be the case
  if DEFSTR X was encountered when the program in question is executed.

         ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ ùWhizWare has a solution, gee whiz. ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

            We call it GeeWhiz -- An on-line language information
            system for anyone writing programs in GW-BASIC.

               GeeWhiz is quick.  Easy to install and easy to use!

            And it runs on nearly any PC running DOS 3.0 or later.
            Color or mono, with or without a Mouse.  Only half a meg
            or so of system disk space is needed to hold all of this
            compacted wealth of knowledge.
                                                           (continued)

            The "on-line" concept:  While editing and debugging you
            can SHELL to GeeWhiz, find facts quickly and return to
            where you were.  Done with a Function Key, we call this
            a hot-key, hot-line for spontaneous programming help.

            GeeWhiz is loaded with proven tricks of the trade, too.
            It was written by a professional programmer that has
            written thousands of successful applications in BASIC,
            dating from the earliest versions of CBASIC, MBASIC and
            the many variants since.  Thus, the "techniques" examples
            are really useful modules of code that really do work.
