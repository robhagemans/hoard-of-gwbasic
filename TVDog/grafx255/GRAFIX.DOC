			   CHAPTER 1 - Introduction


GRAFIX	is a  memory resident  graphics and  sound program  for your  Tandy 1000
series personal  computer. It provides you  with a complete set  of graphics and
sound  functions that  can be  executed from  your favorite programming language
such as compiled BASIC and PASCAL. To  use GRAFIX just install it when you start
up your computer by including the following lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  TANDY11
  GRAFIX

That's all there is to it. Since the  program is memory resident you can use any
of  the program's  sound and  graphic functions  anytime you  want. The  TANDY11
program is  necessary if own  a Tandy 1000  SL or Tandy  1000 TL computer.  This
enables those computers to do 640x200x16 color graphics. (See chapter 4 for more
information on the TANDY11 program)

The following list are some of the functions GRAFIX provides you with:

  Points
  Lines
  Circles and ellipses
  Line and solid boxes
  Filling irregular areas with color
  Storing and transferring areas of the graphic screen
  Variable screen viewport
  Multiple video pages
  Printing text strings on the graphics screen
  Graphics text cursor
  Using the Tandy 1000's 3 voice sound and noise capabilities
  Making sounds and noises in background while your program executes
  Changing the speed of the system timer for precise sound and noise duration
  Three different graphic modes supported:
    160x200x16 color graphics
    320x200x16 color graphics
    640x200x16 color graphics (Tandy 1000 SL/TL only)

These functions are accessed by passing  the GRAFIX program a set values through
your computer's  CPU registers and  executing an INT  instruction. Sounds pretty
easy, huh! Well, you  never have to be that concerned with  the mechanics of the
GRAFIX	program. I  have provided  you with  a set  of interfacing  programs for
compiled BASIC	and PASCAL. These  interfaces act as  a translator between  your
program and the GRAFIX program. For example, if you wanted to draw a blue box in
Turbo PASCAL all you have to do is include a line like this in your program:

  DrawBox(0, 0, 319, 199, 1);

The interface  takes the values  passed to  it,  places the values  into the CPU
registers, and	executes the INT  instruction without you  ever having to  worry
about  those  intricate  details.  The	following  is  list  of  interfaces  for
programming languages currently provided:

  Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.0 and greater
  Borland Turbo BASIC 1.0 - 1.1
  SPECTRA Publishing PowerBASIC 2.0 and greater
  Microsoft QuickPASCAL 1.0 and greater
  Borland Turbo PASCAL 4.0 and greater

Chapter 2 describes the BASIC and PASCAL programming interfaces telling you what
each function does and how to use it  in your program. For those of you who have
a different programming  language and would  like to design  your own interface,
read chapter  3. This describes the  ASSEMBLY language interface for  GRAFIX. It
gives all  the technical information necessary	for setting up an  interface for
any other  programming language such as  C. Chapter 4 discusses  the two utility
programs, ADJMEM and  TANDY11 provided with the GRAFIX	package. Chapter 5 gives
all the miscellaneous details of GRAFIX.

	      CHAPTER 2 - BASIC And PASCAL Programming Interfaces


This chapter describes	the BASIC and PASCAL programming  interfaces for GRAFIX.
All the  functions are listed in  alphabetical order with a  description of what
the function  does, an explanation of  each parameter, and an  example of how to
use  it in  your program  for  both  BASIC and	PASCAL. Following  the functions
listing there is a section on the necessary steps to integrate the interface for
each language product into your program.


Functions summary for BASIC and PASCAL:

********************************************************************************

  Animate(X, Y, Image[Index], Duration)
    Animates an image as described in the 'ExtPut' function.

    It	automatically  transfers  and  erases  the  image  all	in one step. The
    duration  is the  amount of  time to  pause between  the transfer  and erase
    stages of the function. This can help  adjust the amount of flicker. (Do not
    confuse the duration for this function with the duration for the 'ExtSound',
    'Noise', and 'Delay' functions. The duration here is in no way tied to clock
    ticks or the 8253 timer chip)

  Parameters:
    X - Horizontal position of image
    Y - Vertical position of image
    Image[Index] - Integer array  holding saved image starting	at the specified
		   index
    Duration is a number 1 - 65535:
      This is the amount of delay between transfer and erase of image

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL Animate(X, Y, Image%(0), Duration%)
    PASCAL
      Animate(X, Y, Image[0], Duration);

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

  Ellipse(X, Y, MajorAxis, MinorAxis)
    Draws an ellipse centered at the specified X, Y position using the specified
    major and minor axes and current drawing color.

    When you draw a  circle you specify an X, Y center	along with a radius. The
    radius  is a  single number  that indicates  how many  points away	from the
    center the circle should expand out. The  radius is in fact broken down into
    two  separate numbers;  a number  of horizontal  and vertical  points. These
    numbers  are derived  from the  current  setting  of the  aspect ratio.  The
    horizontal and vertical number of points are called the major and minor axes
    of the ellipse.  Using the aspect ratio to break  down the radius into these
    two  parts has  it's limitations.   Calling the  ellipse procedure  with the
    specified major  and minor axes  gives you the  ultimate control in  drawing
    circular shapes.

  Parameters:
    X - Horizontal center of ellipse
    Y - Vertical center of ellipse
    MajorAxis - Size of major axis
    MinorAxis - Size of minor axis

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL Ellipse(160, 100, 50, 40)
    PASCAL
      Ellipse(160, 100, 50, 40);

********************************************************************************

  EllipseC(X, Y, MajorAxis, MinorAxis, Color)
    Draws an ellipse centered at the specified X, Y position using the specified
    major and minor axes and specified color.

    See the 'Ellipse' function for a description of an ellipse.

  Parameters:
    X - Horizontal center of ellipse
    Y - Vertical center of ellipse
    MajorAxis - Size of major axis
    MinorAxis - Size of minor axis
    Color - Color of ellipse

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL EllipseC(160, 100, 50, 40, 1)
    PASCAL
      EllipseC(160, 100, 50, 40, 1);

********************************************************************************

  ExtCircle(X, Y, Radius)
    Draws a circle  centered at X, Y using the	specified radius, current values
    of aspect ratio and current drawing color.

    See the 'SetAspect' function for a description of the aspect ratio.

    X - Horizontal center of circle
    Y - Vertical center of circle
    Radius - Radius of circle

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtCircle(160, 100, 75)
    PASCAL
      ExtCircle(160, 100, 75)

********************************************************************************

  ExtCircleC(X, Y, Radius, Color)
    Draws a circle  centered at X, Y using the	specified radius, current values
    of aspect ratio and the specified color.

    See the 'SetAspect' function for a complete description of the aspect ratio.

  Parameters:
    X - Horizontal center of circle
    Y - Vertical center of circle
    Radius - Radius of circle
    Color - Color of circle

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtCircleC(160, 100, 75, 1)
    PASCAL
      ExtCircle(160, 100, 75, 1)

********************************************************************************

  ExtGet(X1, Y1, X2, Y2, Image[Index])
    Stores a graphics image from X1, Y1 to X2, Y2 into the an integer array.

    This is used  with the 'ExtPut' function to store  and transfer areas of the
    graphics  screen. Be  EXTREMELY careful  when using  this function in making
    sure the array is large enough to  hold the entire image you are storing. If
    not,  this	function  will	cheerfully  overwrite  anything after the ending
    position of  the array in  your program. This  includes other variables,  or
    even  program instructions.  The result   would be	less than  pleasurable I
    assure you. Fortunately, there is a simple solution to this problem that can
    be set up in your program to  see that this terrible event never occurs. Use
    the following procedure to determine if  the array is large enough to safely
    store the whole image:

    SafeSize = ((W / 4) + 6) * H
       H - Image's number of points in height
       W - Image's number of points in width

    ArraySize = L - S + 1
       L - Integer array's largest possible index number
       S - Integer array's smallest possible index number

    IF ArraySize < SafeSize THEN DON'T execute this function

    Most programming  languages allow you  to determine an  array's smallest and
    largest index number.  If the language you are working  in doesn't have this
    capability then you'll have to supply those figures yourself.

  Parameters:
    X1 - Upper left horizontal position to store
    Y1 - Upper left vertical position to store
    X2 - Lower right horizontal position to store
    Y2 - Lower right vertical position to store
    Image[Index] - Integer array to hold graphic image starting at the specified
		   index

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtGet(0, 0, 50, 75, Image%(0))
    PASCAL
      ExtGet(0, 0, 50, 75, Image[0]);

********************************************************************************

  ExtLine(X1, Y1, X2, Y2)

  Parameters:
    X1 - Upper left horizontal position of line
    Y1 - Upper left vertical position of line
    X2 - Lower right horizontal position of line
    Y2 - Lower right vertical position of line

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtLine(10, 15, 100, 150)
    PASCAL
      ExtLine(10, 15, 100, 150);

********************************************************************************

    X1 - Upper left horizontal position of line
    Y1 - Upper left vertical position of line
    X2 - Lower right horizontal position of line
    Y2 - Lower right vertical position of line
    Color - Color of line

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtLineC(10, 15, 100, 150, 1)
    PASCAL
      ExtLineC(10, 15, 100, 150, 1);

********************************************************************************

  ExtPaint(X, Y, FillColor, BoundaryColor)
    Fills  an enclosed	shape starting	at X,  Y with  the specified  fill color
    stopping at the specified boundary color.

    An example of using  the ExtPaint function would be if you	drew a circle in
    red and wanted  to fill the interior with  a blue. If you gave  the starting
    position  as the  center of  the circle,  the fill	color as  blue, and  the
    boundary color as red; the interior  would be filled with blue while leaving
    the red border of the circle alone.

  Parameters:
    X - Starting horizontal position to paint
    Y - Starting vertical position to paint
    FillColor - Color used to fill the paint area
    BoundaryColor - Color at which to stop painting

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtPaint(100, 10, 5, 14)
    PASCAL
      ExtPaint(100, 10, 5, 14);

********************************************************************************

 ExtPut(X, Y, Image[Index], PutAction)
   Transfers a	graphics image stored with  'ExtGet' starting at X,  Y using the
   specified action.

   Action is 1 of 5 options described as follows:

     1 = PRESET - Produces a numeric opposite of the color stored
		  in the array:

		    Array Color   Screen Color
		    -----------   ------------
			00	       15
			01	       14
			02	       13
			03	       12
			04	       11
			05	       10
			06	       09
			07	       08
			08	       07
			09	       06

			12	       03
			13	       02
			14	       01
			15	       00

     2 = PSET - Transfers the image exactly as it was stored.

     3 = AND - Does a logical AND  between the point on the screen and the color
	       in the array.

     4 = OR - Does a logical OR between the point on the screen and the color in
	      the array.

     5 = XOR - Does a logical XOR between the  point on the screen and the color
	       in the array. When PUT against a background twice, the background
	       is  restored. This  allows animation  to take  place. To  perform
	       animation do the following:

		 1) PUT the image on the screen
		 2) Calculate the next X, Y position
		 3) PUT the image at the previous X, Y position
		 4) Repeat Step 1

  Parameters:
    X - Horizontal position to transfer image
    Y - Vertical position to transfer image
    Image[Index] - Integer array holding graphic image starting at the specified
		   index
    PutAction - Action to use when transferring image

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtPut(10, 20, Image%(0), 5)
    PASCAL
      ExtPut(10, 20, Image[0], 5);

********************************************************************************

  ExtSound(Frequency, Duration, Volume, Channel)
    Generates a sound with the	specified frequency, duration, volume, and sound
    channel.

    This function works  exactly like the SOUND function  in the special version
    of GW-BASIC that came with you Tandy  1000. Sounds can be made in background
    if you enable sound buffering. This means that your program will continue to
    execute while sounds  are being made. Each sound channel  has it's own sound
    buffer. Each buffer can hold up to 64 entries.

  Parameters:
    Frequency is a number 110 - 32767:
      This is  the tone to produce  in Hertz. Certain frequencies  correspond to
      musical  notes.	The  following	chart  shows   the  frequency  for  each
      corresponding note:

      The Texas Instruments SN76496 sound chip	in the Tandy 1000 cannot produce
      frequencies below  110 Hertz. If you  use the above chart  please remember
      you cannot make notes below A2.

    Duration is a number 0 - 65535:
      This is the number of clock ticks the sound will last. See the 'FastTimer'
      function for more information on clock ticks.

    Volume is a number 0 - 15:
      0 is the quietest.
      15 is the loudest.

    Sound channel is a number 0 - 2:
      This is  the sound channel  to use when  producing the sound.  You can set
      each sound channel to a different tone to make a 3-note chord.

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL ExtSound(880, 8, 7, 0)
    PASCAL
      ExtSound(880, 8, 7, 0);

********************************************************************************

  FastTimer(Speed)
    Sets the speed of the 8253 timer chip.

    The 8253 timer chip is the driving force behind the 'ExtSound', 'Noise', and
    'Pause' functions. These functions rely on a certain period of time to last.
    This period of time  is known as a clock tick. When  you first start-up your
    computer  the  timer  chip	is  set  at  18.2  clock  ticks  per second. The
    'FastTimer' function allows  you to change the speed to  a rate greater than
    that. The  reason for this is  to increase the performance	of the functions
    previously mentioned. The 'ExtSound' function is a good example. You can use
    the 'ExtSound' function to produce notes  to make music. There is a limiting
    factor in  that at a  rate of 18.2	clock ticks per  second notes that  last
    1/19th or less their normal time cannot be produced. GW-BASIC sets the timer
    chip to  run at 4  times it's normal  rate when it  uses the PLAY statement.
    This allows it to make notes up to 1/64th their normal time. The 'FastTimer'
    function allows you to run the timer  chip up to 256 times it's normal rate.
    This gives	you almost unlimited  flexibility in writing  programs that make
    sounds or  noises to last  exactly as long	as you want.  Another area where
    this function can  be useful is in the  use of the 'Pause' function.  A more
    precise time than 1/18th of a second can be used if you need it. I recommend
    that you use values of 8 or less  if you are going to use this function only
    for sounds or  noises and set it to  rates greater than that for  only short
    periods of time in the use of  the 'Pause' function. This is because running
    the 8253 timer  faster than it's normal setting will  cause your computer to
    run slower. The higher the rate setting the slower your computer will run.

    An extremely important  thing to remember about using  this function is that
    you MUST use the 'ResetTimer' function  before you end your program. Failure
    to do so can result in anything from your current time of day being wrong to
    a locked up computer system. Avoid using  this function if you are using the
    debugging facilities  of one of the  compilers. As soon as	a break point is
    reached the program  is ended for all practical purposes.  The main thing to
    remember is the 'ResetTimer' timer	function must be executed before control
    is passed back to the operating system or the compiler you are working with.

  Parameters:
    Speed is a number 2 - 256:
      This is the number  of times greater you want the 8253  timer chip to run.
      A setting of 4 will make it run 4 times faster than before. This will make
      clock ticks occur 72.8 times a second.

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL FastTimer(8)
    PASCAL
      FastTimer(4);

  PageCopy(Source, Destination)
    Copies the source video page to the destination video page.

    The following is a table showing the video modes that GRAFIX supports on the
    Tandy 1000:

			    Memory    Video   Page #
    Screen Size   Colors   Required   Pages   Range
    -----------   ------   --------   -----   ------
      160x200	    16	     16K	8      0-7
      320x200	    16	     32K	4      0-3
      640x200	    16	     64K	2      0-2 (Tandy 1000 SL/TL only)

    The memory required  is the amount of memory needed  for one graphic screen.
    The Tandy 1000 has the ability to access  up to 128K of video memory. As you
    can see each graphic screen is less than 128K in size. The Tandy 1000 allows
    you to select which part of that 128K you want to work with as well as which
    part you want to display on your monitor. These graphic screens are known as
    video  pages. You  can work  with one  video page  while displaying another.
    There are two types  of video pages, a Display page and  an Active page. The
    Display page is  the one that shows up on  your computer monitor. The Active
    page is the  one that all the graphic  functions will work with. The  two do
    not  have to  be  the  same. You  can for  example work   with page  1 while
    displaying	page 0.  When you  initially enter  any of  the video  modes the
    Active  and Display  pages are  both set  to 0.  You can  change these  with
    'SetActivePage' and  'SetDisplayPage' functions. The  number of video  pages
    you have to work with depends on  the video mode you choose. The above table
    shows  the maximum	number of  video  pages  for each  video mode.	One very
    important  thing to  remember before  using video  pages is  that the  Tandy
    1000's video  memory MUST first  be protected. See  the 'ADJMEM' section  in
    chapter 4 for an explanation of why this must be done.

  Parameters:
    Source - The video page to copy from.
    Destination - The video page to copy to.

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL PageCopy(1, 0)
    PASCAL
      PageCopy(0, 1);

    Changes the  color palette using  16 elements of  an integer array	starting
    with the specified index value.

    Each array element	holds the new color value  for the corresponding palette
    entry. See the 'SetPalette' function for a description of palette registers.

  Parameters:
    PaletteArray[Index] - Integer holding the  palette entries starting with the
			  specified index.

  Pause(Delay)
    Delays a program for the specified number of clock ticks.

    Clock  ticks occur	at a  default rate  of 18.2  times a  second unless  the
    'FastTimer'  function  is  used.  A  number  of  36  would	delay  a program
    approximately 2  seconds at the default  clock tick rate. This  function has
    the  advantage being  more precise	than a	high level  language delay  loop
    because  it uses  an assembly  language interface.	Use it	when you need to
    delay for a precise number of clock ticks.

  Parameters:
    Delay - Number of clock ticks to delay program. See the 'FastTimer' function
	    for more information on clock ticks.

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL Pause(20)
    PASCAL
      Pause(20);

  SetAspect(XAspect, YAspect)
    Sets the horizontal and vertical portions of the aspect ratio used in circle
    drawing.

    The three different video modes that the GRAFIX program supports each have a
    different number  of points horizontally  than vertically. For  example, the
    640x200x16	color graphics	mode has  640 points  horizontally by 200 points
    vertically. Another factor	is the computer monitor you  are using. Computer
    monitors  are just	like televisions  sets in  that ratio  to the  number of
    points horizontally  to the number	of points vertically  is 4:3. These  two
    factors mean that when you draw a  shape on the graphics screen it will look
    out  of proportion	to it's  size. For  example a  100x100 box  drawn on the
    640x200 graphics screen would like approximately like this:

				   ********
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   *	  *
				   ********

    The box  is 100 points high  by 100 points wide,  yet it is not  square. Any
    shape  drawn in  any one  of the  three graphics  mode will  suffer the same
    result unless  the points are scaled  in proportion to the	4:3 ratio of the
    computer monitor and to the number of horizontal and vertical points for the
    graphics  mode being  used. The  scaling factor  used in  drawing circles is
    called the aspect ratio. This is calculated by dividing the number of points
    horizontally by the number of points vertically. Divide this number by 4 and
    then multiply  by 3. The aspect  ratio for the 640x200  graphics mode is 2.4
    ((640 / 200) / 4) * 3). There is a problem in that the GRAFIX program cannot
    accept fractional numbers as a parameter.  The solution here is to break the
    aspect ratio into two parts: a horizontal portion and vertical portion. This
    can be done for any graphics mode  by dividing down the number of horizontal
    and vertical  points until they  both cannot be  divided evenly anymore  and
    scaling the horizontal portion. The 640x200 mode would work like this:

      640   64	 16   16 / 4   4   4 * 3   12
      --- : -- : -- : --     : - : -	 : --
      200   20	  5    5       5   5	    5

    The  final	answer	is  12:5.  First  we  divided  640:200 down to 16:5. The
    horizontal portion	was then scaled by  dividing by 4 and  multiplying by 3.
    You will notice that 12 divided by 5 happens to be 2.4.

    Each graphics mode has a default aspect  ratio so that circles drawn will be
    perfectly round. The reason you are  allowed to change the aspect ratio with
    this function  is that you	may not  want  to draw a  perfectly round circle
    every time. By  changing the aspect ratio values you  can draw a circle that
    is	more elongated	either horizontally  or vertically.  This gives you much
    more flexibility in drawing circular shapes.

  Parameters:
    XAspect - Horizontal portion of the aspect ratio
    YAspect - Vertical portion of the aspect ratio

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL SetAspect(12, 5)
    PASCAL
      SetAspect(12, 5);

  SetPalette(Palette, Color)
    Allows you to redefine any one of the 16 palette registers.

    Palettes registers are special areas in the video system that determine what
    colors are displayed on the screen. There  are 16 in all allowing for the 16
    different colors. By default each palette register has the same value as its
    corresponding color number.  For example, palette register 1  has a value of
    1, which is blue, and palette register 5 has a value of 5, which is magenta.
    This means that all 16 palette registers initially have the values 0-15.

  Parameters:
    Palette - Palette register number to set
    Color - New color value for palette register

  Examples:
    BASIC
      CALL SetPalette(1, 10)
    PASCAL
      SetPalette(1, 10);

    BASIC
      CALL SetPlotColor(5)

  SetView(MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY)
    Sets the screen viewport boundary values.

    The  screen viewport  is an  area  in  which all  graphics functions  except
    'PrintString' and 'PrintStringX'  must fit. If not, they  are clipped on the
    viewport's boundaries. The  default size of the screen  viewport is the size
    of the  screen mode being used.  For example, if you  were in the 320x200x16
    color graphics mode  and drew a line from  0, 0, to 500, 199;  the line's X2
    value would be clipped at 319 which is the default maximum horizontal border
    value for that screen mode. You can set the screen viewport to any size that
    you want. The only limitation is that the values can be no smaller or larger
    than  the  physical  size  of  the	screen	mode  you  are	working  in. The
    'PrintString' and  'PrintStringX' functions ignore	the screen viewport  and
    place text anywhere  on the screen. This is because  you are working in text
    screen coordinates and not graphics screen coordinates.

  Parameters:
    MinX - Minimum horizontal border value
    MinY - Minimum vertical border value
    MaxX - Maximum horizontal border value
    MaxY - Maximum vertical border value

QuickBASIC programming interface:

  To use GRAFIX  with the QuickBASIC programming environment  simply type in the
  following line:

    QB /L GRAFQBS

  This will  start QuickBASIC and load	in the interface for  GRAFIX which is in
  the GRAFQBS.QLB quick library. The next  step to use GRAFIX in your QuickBASIC
  programs  is	to  make  sure	that  every  program  you  write begins with the
  following line:

    '$INCLUDE: 'GRAFQBS.INC' 

  GRAFQBS.INC  contains  all  the  subprogram  definitions  necessary to use the
  QuickBASIC  interface  for  GRAFIX.  The  interface  for  GRAFIX  expects  all
  variables  passed to	it to  be of  type integer  so GRAFQBS.INC  contains the
  following line:

    DEFINT A-Z

  This	makes sure  that all  variables used  in your  program are  of the  type
  integer  by default.	If you	compile a  program from  outside the  QuickBASIC
  programming environment, be  sure to specify the GRAFQBS.LIB	library when you
  use the LINK program to create the EXE file.

  The interface  provided for QuickBASIC  is for version  4.5. If you  are still
  using version 4.0 following these steps to create a new set of libraries:

    1) Compile the GRAFIX.QBS file with the BC.EXE program like this:
	 BC grafix.qbs;

    2) Create a new object library with the LIB.EXE program like this:
	 LIB grafqbs -+grafix.obj,nul,grafqbs

    3) Create a new quick library with the LINK.EXE program like this:
	 LINK /q grafqbs.lib,,nul,bqlb40


Turbo BASIC and PowerBASIC programming interfaces:

  Using the the  Turbo BASIC and PowerBASIC interfaces for  GRAFIX are easy. For
  Turbo BASIC make  sure that every program you write  starts with the following
  line:

    $INCLUDE "GRAFTBS.INC"

  For  PowerBASIC  make  sure  that  every  program  you  write  starts with the
  following line:

    $INCLUDE "GRAFPBS.INC"

  The interfaces for  Turbo BASIC and PowerBASIC are almost  entirely made up of
  INLINE  assembler subprograms.  Be careful  when making  calls to GRAFIX using
  both interfaces because no checking is done by either compiler to validate the
  number of  parameters or type  of variables used  when you make  the call. For
  example, if typed in	the following program all bets are off	as to what would
  be drawn on the screen:

    $INCLUDE "GRAFTBS.INC"
    CALL MediumGraphics
    X1 = 0
    Y1 = 0
    X2 = 319
    Y2 = 199
    Color = 1
    CALL ExtLine(X1, Y1, X2, Y2, Color)

  The ExtLine function only  expects 4 parameters to be passed to  it not 5. Pay
  close attention to the number of  parameters a certain function requires. This
  will save you  a lot of headache later. Another  problem you may encounter can
  be found by just changing a few lines in the above example:

    $INCLUDE "GRAFPBS.INC"
    DEFDBL X
    CALL MediumGraphics
    X1 = 0
    Y1 = 0
    X2 = 319
    Y2 = 199
    CALL ExtLine(X1, Y1, X2, Y2)

  The previous problem	of the number of parameters has  been fixed, but now the
  call won't work because of the 'DEFDBL X' statement. This causes all variables
  starting with  the letter X to  be of type double  precision. Double precision
  variables are floating point numbers 8 bytes in length each. The interface for
  GRAFIX  expects all  variables passed  to it	to be  of type	integer. Integer
  variables  are whole	numbers 2  bytes  in  length each.  The GRAFTBS.INC  and
  GRAFPBS.INC files contains the following line:

    DEFINT A-Z

  This	makes sure  that all  variables used  in your  program are  of the  type
  integer by default.

  Also be careful  when using an implicit variable type  other than integer. The
  following example shows what I mean:

    $INCLUDE "GRAFPBS.INC"
    CALL MediumGraphics
    X1# = 0
    Y1# = 0
    X2# = 319
    Y2# = 199
    CALL ExtLine(X1#, Y1#, X2#, Y2#)

  When you attach  '#' to a variable you  are declaring it to be  of type double
  precision. Just be careful the type of  variable you pass to a GRAFIX function
  since no type checking is done by the either compiler.


QuickPASCAL and Turbo PASCAL programming interface:

  The interfaces for  QuickPASCAL and Turbo PASCAL are identical  in the way you
  incorporate them into your program. To  use GRAFIX in your PASCAL program just
  list GRAFIX as one of the units in your program's USES statement like this:

    USES
      Grafix;

  That's all there is to it.

  Turbo PASCAL versions 4.0 to 5.5 units are not compatible, so I do not provide
  the compiled	GRAFIX unit with the  package. You can easily  create the GRAFIX
  unit by loading  the program GRAFIX.PAS into Turbo PASCAL  and compiling it to
  disk. This was the easiest way to solve the compatibility problem.

		 CHAPTER 3  - ASSEMBLER Programming Interface


This chapter gives the technical details of the GRAFIX package. It will give you
the  necessary	information  to  write	an  ASSEMBLY  language interface for the
programming language you  are working with. I'm going to  assume that anyone who
reads this chapter  already knows how to program in  80x86 ASSEMBLY language. If
you don't  then I suggest that  you skip this section.  It probably will confuse
you more than help.

An ASSEMBLY language interface for GRAFIX is  the key to writing an interface in
another programming language. The BASIC  and PASCAL interfaces provided with the
package  are written  in ASSEMBLER.  GRAFIX is	a memory  resident program,  all
requests  to it  are done  through  the  video BIOS  interrupt. The  AH register
contains  the hexadecimal  value EE  which indicates  to GRAFIX  that a function
request is about  to be made. The AL register  contains the function number. The
remaining registers  BX, CX, DX,  SI, DI, and  DS contain the  parameters of the
requested function.  For example, if  you wanted  to  draw a solid  green box on
screen from 0, 0 - 319, 199 the function call would look like this:

	MOV	AX,0EE11H	;Draw solid box function
	MOV	BX,0		;X1 location in BX
	MOV	CX,0		;Y1 location in CX
	MOV	SI,319		;X2 location in SI
	MOV	DI,199		;Y2 location in DI
	MOV	DX,2		;Box color in DX
	INT	10H		;Call GRAFIX

The  next section  of this  chapter will  list each  of the  GRAFIX functions in
numerical order. The format of each function listing is as follows:

Title
Function number
Description
Register entry values
Register exit values
Example
Comments

The title  is the name	I use for  the function in  the ASSEMBLY language source
file, it is just listed here for  reference purposes. The function number is the
the value for  the AL register, it is listed  in decimal format. The description
explains  what each  function does.  The register  entry values  are the  values
required to execute  the function. The exit values are	any register values that
the function might  return to your program. The example  is an ASSEMBLY language
code fragment showing  a call to GRAFIX for that  function. The comments section
is optional  and is included  only where I  feel extra clarification  is needed.
Entry values for the AX register for each function are in hexadecimal.

  The reason  I provided a  cursor was for  the text support.  When you turn the
  cursor on  it acts exactly  like the cursor  you have in  text screen mode. It
  advances 8 points at time up and down so it will always cover a text character
  evenly.  One example	of using  the text  cursor is  if you  develop an  input
  routine. You could  turn the cursor on to show  the current position where the
  person was typing.  You could use the half cursor  size to indicate the person
  had pressed the insert key and now the insert state is active.

  Here is a list of each subfunction's description:

  BX = 00:
	 This will enable you to determine if the GRAFIX program is installed or
	 not. If it is resident the AX register will contain the value 0DEADH to
	 indicate this	fact. This is  useful to make  sure the program  you are
	 going to run was loaded after the GRAFIX program.

  BX = 01:
	 This will let you determine the  current status of the graphics system.
	 The system  must be enabled before  any of it's functions  can be used.
	 This is a handy little item to have to make sure the graphics system is
	 enabled before attempting to use any of the functions.

  BX = 02:
	 This enables all functions in the  graphics system and enters the Tandy
	 1000's 320x200x16 color graphics mode.  It also resets all the graphics
	 variables to their default state.

  BX = 03:
	 This disables all functions in the graphics system and enters the 80x25
	 text screen mode.

  BX = 04:
	 This  turns all  current sound  processing off.  All current sounds are
	 turned  off,  the  sound  buffer  is  cleared,  and  sound buffering is
	 disabled.

  BX = 05:
	 This turns sound buffering on allowing you to make sounds in background
	 while your program is executing.

  BX = 06:
	 This turns  sound buffering off. The  current sound is left  alone, but
	 the sound buffer is cleared of any remain sounds to make.

  BX = 07:
	 This  turns all  current noise  processing off.  All current noises are
	 turned  off,  the  noise  buffer  is  cleared,  and  noise buffering is
	 disabled.

  BX = 08:
	 This turns noise buffering on allowing you to make noises in background
	 while your program is executing.

  BX = 09:
	 This turns  noise buffering off. The  current noise is left  alone, but
	 the noise buffer is cleared of any remain noises to make.

  BX = 10:
	 This  turns all  current noise  and sound  processing off.  All current
	 noises  and sounds  are turned  off, the  noise and  sound buffers  are
	 cleared, and noise and sound buffering is disabled.

  BX = 11:
	 This enables all functions in the  graphics system and enters the Tandy
	 1000  SL/TL's 640x200x16  color graphics  mode. It  also resets all the
	 graphics variables to their default state.

  BX = 12:
	 This indicates whether the 640x200x16 color graphics mode functions are
	 supported.

  BX = 13:
	 This enables all functions in the  graphics system and enters the Tandy
	 1000's 160x200x16 color graphics mode.  It also resets all the graphics
	 variables to their default state.

		      CHAPTER 4 - GRAFIX Utility Programs


This chapter discusses TANDY11 and ADJMEM the two utility programs provided with
the GRAFIX package.

TANDY11:

  Tandy corporation made 2 excellent computers in the Tandy 1000 SL and TL. They
  had 2  things previous members  of the Tandy	1000 series family  didn't have,
  digital  sound and  640x200x16 color	graphics. The  special 640x200x16  color
  graphics mode was of special interest to  me since I have been programming the
  320x200x16 color  graphics mode for  some time.  When  I got my  Tandy 1000 SL
  Technical Reference Manual, I was shocked  that there wasn't even a mention of
  this	special  video	mode.  There  was  documentation  for  the digital sound
  interface, but not the 640x200x16 color graphics mode. I came across a program
  that used this video mode and with DEBUG  I was able to see how to the program
  accessed  it. This  limited information  enabled me  to figure  how the  video
  memory was set up  and how to program the video system  registers to enter the
  640x200x16 color  graphics mode. I was  now able to start  programming in this
  special graphics mode.

  The reason  I wrote this  program was that  all the other  video modes on  the
  Tandy  1000  series  computers  are	supported  by  the  system  BIOS  (Basic
  Input/Output	System), but  not the	640x200x16 color  graphics mode.  If the
  system BIOS supports the video mode you want	to work in, then you have a full
  set of  built in video  functions at your  disposal. These include  entering a
  particular video mode, writing characters  to the screen, scrolling the screen
  up  or down,	setting the  cursor  position,	etc. Without  them, you  have to
  include that logic in every program  you write separately. Seeing this was not
  the best situation to  say the least, I wrote a set  of BIOS routines that are
  memory resident.  These can be called  just like any other  BIOS routine. They
  effectively duplicate the functions included in Tandy's regular video BIOS. So
  now  instead of  including scores  of  lines	of Assembler  code to  enter the
  640x200x16 color graphics in every program you  write, you can simply do it in
  2 lines of Assembly language like this:

    MOV     AX,11	    ;Set up 640x200x16 color graphics mode
    INT     10H		    ; ..

  I'd say that was a lot easier, wouldn't  you. You can also do it from any high
  level language like BASIC, C, or PASCAL as long as that language has access to
  BIOS services on your computer. So now to have full access to this video mode,
  you only  have to install this  program when you start  up your computer. Just
  put the following command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

    TANDY11

  The program verifies that the computer is a Tandy 1000 SL/TL before attempting
  to install itself into memory.


ADJMEM:

  IBM compatible  computers other than the  Tandy 1000 use a  video adapter that
  has the  video memory contained  on the adapter  itself. The Tandy  1000 video
  adapter  uses  the  very  top  portion  of  DOS  memory  as video memory. (The
  exceptions to this are the Tandy 1000  TX, TL, and TL/2 which have the ability
  to add  an extra 128K of  memory which is then  used as the video  memory. The
  full 640K of DOS memory is then available at all times)

  The following table shows the memory requirements for each screen mode used on
  the Tandy 1000:

				       Memory	 Video
  Mode #    Screen Mode     Colors    Required	 Pages
  ------    -----------     ------    --------	 -----

   0-1	     40x25 Text       16	16K	   8
   2-3	     80x25 Text       16	16K	   4
   4-5	  320x200 Graphics     4	16K	   8
     6	  640x200 Graphics     2	16K	   8
     8	  160x200 Graphics    16	16K	   8
     9	  320x200 Graphics    16	32K	   4
    10	  640x200 Graphics     4	32K	   4
  * 11	  640x200 Graphics    16	64K	   2

    * - Tandy 1000 SL/TL only supported through the use of the TANDY11 program

  The video  pages for the  graphics mode are  based on reserving  128K of video
  memory.  The Tandy  1000 has	the ability  to address  this much video memory.
  Multiple  video pages  are useful  for high  performance animation. The GRAFIX
  programming package supports multiple video pages.

  The top 16K of  DOS memory is always protected by BIOS  at start-up. If one of
  the  32K or  greater graphics  modes are   used that	area of  memory is  left
  unprotected. This can result in a  hung computer if precautions are not taken.
  Historically, when you protected that portion of memory the only way to get it
  back	was  reboot  your  computer.  That  is	why  I	wrote  this  program. It
  dynamically  protects that  extra memory  and then  allows you  to get it back
  again.

  The  following  batch  file  shows  how  you	could  protect the 32K of memory
  necessary  while working  in BIOS  screen modes  9 or  10 and  then release it
  again:

    ECHO OFF
    REM  Protect 32K of video memory
    adjmem -16
    REM  Run required application
    program
    REM  Release protected system memory
    adjmem +16

  Now, instead of  losing that memory while you are  developing your program you
  can protect the memory and then release it again without having to reboot your
  computer.

  To use the program just type ADJMEM +### or ADJMEM -### to add or subtract the
  desired K bytes from your Tandy 1000's memory. Here are some examples:

    ADJMEM -16	    ;Protect 32K of the Tandy 1000's memory
    ADJMEM +16	    ;Release 16K of the Tandy 1000's memory

    ADJMEM -48	    ;Protect 64K of the Tandy 1000's memory
    ADJMEM +48	    ;Release 48K of the Tandy 1000's memory

    ADJMEM -112     ;Protect 128K of the Tandy 1000's memory
    ADJMEM +112     ;Release 112K of the Tandy 1000's memory

  The program accepts any value from -112K  to +112K validating that you are not
  adding  or subtracting  more memory  than is	already necessary.  I wrote  the
  program to accept this range of values to accommodate the Tandy 1000's ability
  to address up to 128K of video  memory. The program verifies that the computer
  is a	Tandy 1000 before attempting  to adjust the system  memory. If the Tandy
  1000	has  a	128K  memory  expansion  option  installed,  no  memory  will be
  protected.

  I hope you find this program as useful  as I have. It can really come in handy
  if you do a lot Tandy 1000 graphics  programming in one of the 32K video modes
  or even the 64K mode on the Tandy 1000 SL/TL.

	  CHAPTER  5 - Miscellaneous Details About The GRAFIX Package


GRAFIX revision history:

1.0 -  Initial release of GRAFIX.


1.1 -  Added additional functions that allowed specifying the drawing color when
       the  function was  called instead  of setting  the current  drawing color
       first and then calling the function.

       Optimized the following functions:
	 $Point, $Line, DrawBox, Circle, Paint,  FillBox, and Put.
	 $Line replaces the $PlotLine function from the previous release.


2.0 -  Added support for the Tandy 1000's 160x200x16 color graphics mode.

       Added support  for Tandy 1000  SL/TL 640x200x16 color  graphics mode with
       the aid of the TANDY11 driver now supplied with the package.

       The package now includes the ADJMEM program for dynamically adjusting the
       Tandy 1000's  memory up or  down from the  command line or  a batch file.
       This  can be  used to  protect the  video memory  only when necessary and
       freeing it up again.

       GRAFIX now verifies the computer is a Tandy 1000 series before installing
       itself into memory.

       Fixed a nasty bug in the Put procedure. Images transferred using the PSET
       option on an even pixel address were not transferred properly.

       Replaced Circle function. The old  function would cause unexpected divide
       by zero errors and crash the computer.

       Added  Ellipse function	for more  flexibility than  the Circle	function
       could provide in drawing circular shapes.

       Added  a host  XOR functions   for point  plotting, line  drawing, circle
       drawing, box drawing, and box filling.

       Added definable viewport. All  graphics functions except PrintString will
       clip on the viewport boundaries.

       Added  'GetScreen'  and	'PutScreen'  functions	for  ultra fast save and
       restore of the video buffer.

       Speeded up the majority of graphic functions by 2-3 times than in version
       1.1.


2.5 -  Added   video   paging	functions:   'SetActivePage',	'GetActivePage',
       'SetDisplayPage', 'GetDisplayPage', and 'PageCopy'.

       Rewrote sound and noise systems for better quality sound and performance.

       Added  8253 timer  functions: 'FastTimer',  'ResetTimer', and 'GetTimer'.
       The 'FastTimer'	function increases the	precesion of the  amount of time
       sounds, noises, and delays will last.

       Included new command line parameter /M  which can be used to indicate how
       much  video  memory  should  be	protected  on  start-up. GRAFIX will now
       protect	up  to	128K  of  video  memory.  Memory  protection  is skipped
       automatically if the Tandy 1000 has a 128K memory expansion option.

       Changed	'ADJMEM' program  to protect   up 128K	of video  memory. Memory
       protection is skipped  automatically if the Tandy 1000  has a 128K memory
       expansion option.

       ADJMEM now verifies  the computer is a Tandy 1000  before it will attempt
       to protect any memory.

2.55 - Decrease memory useage of GRAFIX.COM by over 5,000 bytes.

       Made minor updates to a few demo programs.

Some final items:

  GRAFIX by default will protect the top 32K of DOS memory when it is installed.
  The default is 64K on a Tandy 1000 SL, SL/2, TL, or TL/2. The 'ADJMEM' section
  in chapter  4 explains why this  is necessary. Memory is  not protected if the
  Tandy 1000 is  a TX, TL, or TL/2  with a 128K memory expansion  option. Memory
  protection can be skipped by installing GRAFIX with the /N option like this:

    GRAFIX /N

  You can specify the amount of video memory you want to protect by using the /M
  option. This is useful if you want to protect more than 32K or 64K to do video
  paging safely. The  /M option will accept any  value from 16K to 128K.  If you
  wanted GRAFIX to protect 128K of video memory, just install GRAFIX like this:

    GRAFIX /M128

  The  GRAFIX programming  package represents  well over  2 years  of work on my
  part. I released versions 1.0 and 1.1  not expecting anything in return for my
  efforts. Version 2.0	and greater of this package is	quite a different story.
  The entire  package has been rewritten  and expanded. I think  you will find a
  dramatic  speed   increase  in  most	 of  the  graphics   functions	and  the
  documentation  more  concise	and  easy  to  read.  I  am  now  asking  for  a
  registration of $15.00 for the package.  This will enable me to keep improving
  GRAFIX with  each new release.  Once you send  your registration, you  are not
  required to register	again for any future release of  GRAFIX, except to cover
  the cost of  an update diskette. If you  do decide to send a	registration, or
  want an  update diskette please fill	out the REGISTER.DOC form  provided with
  the package.

  Since the  entire package has been  rewritten, I intend to  keep the assembler
  source code copyrighted  from now on and is therefore  not being included with
  the package starting with version 2.0.

  Any comments or  suggestions you have on the GRAFIX  package should be sent to
  the address at the  top of this document file or I can  be reached on GEnie as
  A.ALBRECHT which is my electronic mail address.
