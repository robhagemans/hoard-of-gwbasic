GRAFIX 2.5 contains the following enhancements:

  Video paging is now supported for high performance animation.

  GRAFIX and ADJMEM will now protect up to 128K of video memory.

  The protection of video memory is  skipped automatically if the Tandy 1000 has
  a 128K memory expansion option.

  The sound  interface has been rewritten  to produce better quality  sounds and
  noises.

  The system  timer chip can  now be programmed  to produce sounds,  noises, and
  delays that last less than 1/18th of a second.


GRAFIX 2.55 contains the following enhancements:

  Uses 5,000 less bytes of memory than GRAFIX 2.5.


TANDY11 problem:

  The TANDY11.COM program  that enables 640x200x16 color graphics  does not work
  properly  on the  Tandy 1000	SL/2, TL/2,  and RL.  When the	640x200x16 color
  graphics mode  is used, all graphic  modes except that one  are distorted. The
  only two ways I have found to get  around the problem so far are to reboot the
  computer or  go into DeskMate and  then exit again. The  program works fine on
  the  Tandy 1000  SL and  TL. Until  the problem  is solved,  do one of the two
  things mentioned to get  the other graphic modes to work again.  I will try to
  correct the situation as soon as possible.
